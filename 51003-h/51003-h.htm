<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>The poems contained in this volume, which comprise the whole of the
<i>Tales</i> and the first eleven of the <i>Tales of the Hall</i>,
are without exception printed from the edition of 1823, the last of
Crabbe’s works published in this country in his lifetime.</p>

<p>The <i>Variants</i> in the <i>Tales</i> are from the first edition
(1812) and from the ‘Original MS.’ readings given as footnotes in the
younger Crabbe’s edition of his father’s <i>Life and Poems</i> (1834).
The <i>Variants</i> in the <i>Tales of the Hall</i> are from the first
edition (1819); from the ‘Original MS.’ readings as above; from the
Crabbe MSS. in the possession of the Cambridge University Press
(which will be described in the Preface to Vol. <span class="smcap">III</span>, where
a much fuller use will be made of them), and from the MSS. in the
valuable collection of Mrs Mackay of Trowbridge, most kindly lent by
her for examination and use (to which the same remark applies). In
the present volume will also be found certain <i>Addenda</i> to the
<i>Variants</i> in Vol. <span class="smcap">I</span>, from the ‘Original MS.’ readings
printed by the younger Crabbe.</p>

<p>Among the <i>Errata</i> in this volume are included a considerable number
of quotations from Shakespeare with wrong indications of acts or
scenes, and occasionally even of the plays from which the passages
are taken. A large proportion of the quotations are in themselves
imperfect, or otherwise incorrect. Perhaps it is stretching
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
a point to treat all these defects as oversights; sometimes Crabbe
may have made intentional changes, and more frequently he may have
been wilfully careless. No readings which he could have found in any
current edition of Shakespeare have been altered.</p>

<p>In the preparation of the present volume, I have again enjoyed
the advantage of the friendly aid and cooperation of Mr <span class="smcap">A. T.
Bartholomew</span>, to whom I am specially indebted for the compilation
of the <i>Variants</i>. Our joint efforts have been occasionally defeated
by the illegibility of passages in the Crabbe MSS. acquired by our
University Press. It is hoped that the third and concluding volume of
this edition, which will contain a considerable amount of previously
unpublished verse, will appear in the course of the summer.</p>

<p class="f120">DUCHESS DOWAGER OF RUTLAND.</p>
<p><br /><span class="smcap">Madam</span>,</p>

<p>The dedication of works of literature to persons of
superior worth and eminence appears to have been a measure
early adopted, and continued to the present time; so that,
whatever objections have been made to the language of dedicators,
such addresses must be considered as perfectly consistent
with reason and propriety; in fact, superior rank and elevated
situation in life naturally and justly claim such respect and it
is the prerogative of greatness to give countenance and favour
to all who appear to merit and to need them; it is likewise the
prerogative of every kind of superiority and celebrity, of personal
merit when peculiar or extraordinary, of dignity, elegance, wealth,
and beauty, certainly of superior intellect and intellectual
acquirements; every such kind of eminence has its privilege,
and, being itself an object of distinguished approbation, it
gains attention for whomsoever its possessor distinguishes and
approves.</p>

<p>Yet the causes and motives for an address of this kind rest
not entirely with the merit of the patron, the feelings of the
author himself having their weight and consideration in the
choice he makes; he may have gratitude for benefits received,
or pride not illaudable in aspiring to the favour of those whose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
notice confers honour; or he may entertain a secret but strong
desire of seeing a name in the entrance of his work which he is
accustomed to utter with peculiar satisfaction, and to hear
mentioned with veneration and delight.</p>

<p>Such, madam, are the various kinds of eminence for which
an author on these occasions would probably seek, and they
meet in your grace; such too are the feelings by which he
would be actuated, and they centre in me: let me therefore
entreat your grace to take this book into your favour and
protection, and to receive it as an offering of the utmost
respect and duty, from,</p>

<p class="author">May it please Your Grace,&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />

<p class="f150 break"><b>PREFACE</b>.</p>

<p>That the appearance of the present work before the public
is occasioned by a favourable reception of the former two,
I hesitate not to acknowledge; because, while the confession
may be regarded as some proof of gratitude, or at least of attention
from an author to his readers, it ought not to be considered
as an indication of vanity. It is unquestionably very pleasant
to be assured that our labours are well received; but, nevertheless,
this must not be taken for a just and full criterion of
their merit: publications of great intrinsic value have been met
with so much coolness, that a writer who succeeds in obtaining
some degree of notice should look upon himself rather as one
favoured than meritorious, as gaining a prize from Fortune, and
not a recompense for desert; and, on the contrary, as it is well
known that books of very inferior kind have been at once
pushed into the strong current of popularity, and are there
kept buoyant by the force of the stream, the writer who
acquires not this adventitious help may be reckoned rather as
unfortunate than undeserving; and from these opposite considerations
it follows, that a man may speak of his success
without incurring justly the odium of conceit, and may likewise
acknowledge a disappointment without an adequate cause for
humiliation or self-reproach.</p>

<p>But were it true that something of the complacency of
self-approbation would insinuate itself into an author’s mind
with the idea of success, the sensation would not be that of
unalloyed pleasure; it would perhaps assist him to bear, but it
would not enable him to escape, the mortification he must
encounter from censures, which, though he may be unwilling
to admit, yet he finds himself unable to confute; as well as
from advice, which, at the same time that he cannot but
approve, he is compelled to reject.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>Reproof and advice, it is probable, every author will receive,
if we except those who merit so much of the former, that the
latter is contemptuously denied them; now of these, reproof,
though it may cause more temporary uneasiness, will in many
cases create less difficulty, since errors may be corrected when
opportunity occurs; but advice, I repeat, may be of such
nature, that it will be painful to reject, and yet impossible to
follow it; and in this predicament I conceive myself to be
placed. There has been recommended to me, and from
authority which neither inclination nor prudence leads me to
resist, in any new work I might undertake, an unity of subject,
and that arrangement of my materials which connects the whole
and gives additional interest to every part; in fact, if not an
Epic Poem, strictly so denominated, yet such composition as
would possess a regular succession of events, and a catastrophe
to which every incident should be subservient, and which every
character, in a greater or less degree, should conspire to accomplish.</p>

<p>In a Poem of this nature, the principal and inferior characters
in some degree resemble a general and his army, where
no one pursues his peculiar objects and adventures, [but] pursues
them in unison with the movements and grand purposes of the
whole body; where there is a community of interests and a
subordination of actors; and it was upon this view of the subject,
and of the necessity for such distribution of persons and events,
that I found myself obliged to relinquish an undertaking, for
which the characters I could command, and the adventures
I could describe, were altogether unfitted.</p>

<p>But if these characters which seemed to be at my disposal
were not such as would coalesce into one body, nor were of
a nature to be commanded by one mind, so neither on examination
did they appear as an unconnected multitude, accidentally
collected, to be suddenly dispersed; but rather beings of whom
might be formed groups and smaller societies, the relations of
whose adventures and pursuits might bear that kind of similitude
to an Heroic Poem, which these minor associations of men (as
pilgrims on the way to their saint, or parties in search of
amusement, travellers excited by curiosity, or adventurers in
pursuit of gain) have in points of connexion and importance
with a regular and disciplined army.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>Allowing this comparison, it is manifest that while much is
lost for want of unity of subject and grandeur of design,
something is gained by greater variety of incident and more
minute display of character, by accuracy of description and
diversity of scene: in these narratives we pass from gay to
grave, from lively to severe, not only without impropriety, but
with manifest advantage. In one continued and connected
Poem, the reader is, in general, highly gratified or severely
disappointed; by many independent narratives, he has the
renovation of hope, although he has been dissatisfied, and
a prospect of reiterated pleasure, should he find himself
entertained.</p>

<p>I mean not, however, to compare these different modes of
writing as if I were balancing their advantages and defects before
I could give preference to either; with me the way I take is
not a matter of choice, but of necessity; I present not my
Tales to the reader as if I had chosen the best method of
ensuring his approbation, but as using the only means I possessed
of engaging his attention.</p>

<p>It may probably be remarked that Tales, however dissimilar,
might have been connected by some associating circumstance to
which the whole number might bear equal affinity, and that
examples of such union are to be found in Chaucer, in Boccace,
and other collectors and inventors of Tales, which, considered
in themselves, are altogether independent; and to this idea
I gave so much consideration as convinced me that I could not
avail myself of the benefit of such artificial mode of affinity.
To imitate the English poet, characters must be found adapted
to their several relations, and this is a point of great difficulty
and hazard; much allowance seems to be required even for
Chaucer himself, since it is difficult to conceive that on any
occasion the devout and delicate Prioress, the courtly and
valiant Knight, and “the poure good Man the persone of a
Towne,” would be the voluntary companions of the drunken
Miller, the licentious Sompnour, and “the Wanton Wife of
Bath,” and enter into that colloquial and travelling intimacy
which, if a common pilgrimage to the shrine of St. Thomas
may be said to excuse, I know nothing beside (and certainly
nothing in these times) that would produce such effect. Boccace,
it is true, avoids all difficulty of this kind, by not assigning to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
the ten relators of his hundred Tales any marked or peculiar
characters; nor, though there are male and female in company,
can the sex of the narrator be distinguished in the narration.
To have followed the method of Chaucer might have been of
use, but could scarcely be adopted, from its difficulty; and
to have taken that of the Italian writer would have been
perfectly easy, but could be of no service: the attempt at union
therefore has been relinquished, and these relations are submitted
to the public, connected by no other circumstance than their
being the productions of the same author, and devoted to the
same purpose, the entertainment of his readers.</p>

<p>It has been already acknowledged, that these compositions
have no pretensions to be estimated with the more lofty and
heroic kind of poems, but I feel great reluctance in admitting
that they have not a fair and legitimate claim to the poetic
character. In vulgar estimation, indeed, all that is not prose
passes for poetry, but I have not ambition of so humble a kind
as to be satisfied with a concession which requires nothing in
the poet, except his ability for counting syllables, and I trust
something more of the poetic character will be allowed to the
succeeding pages than what the heroes of the Dunciad might
share with the author; nor was I aware that by describing, as
faithfully as I could, men, manners, and things, I was forfeiting
a just title to a name which has been freely granted to many
whom to equal, and even to excel, is but very stinted commendation.</p>

<p>In this case it appears that the usual comparison between
poetry and painting entirely fails: the artist who takes an
accurate likeness of individuals, or a faithful representation of
scenery, may not rank so high in the public estimation as one
who paints an historical event, or an heroic action; but he is
nevertheless a painter, and his accuracy is so far from diminishing
his reputation, that it procures for him in general both fame
and emolument; nor is it perhaps with strict justice determined
that the credit and reputation of those verses which strongly
and faithfully delineate character and manners, should be
lessened in the opinion of the public by the very accuracy
which gives value and distinction to the productions of the
pencil.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it must be granted that the pretensions of any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
composition to be regarded as poetry will depend upon that
definition of the poetic character which he who undertakes to
determine the question has considered as decisive; and it is
confessed also that one of great authority may be adopted, by
which the verses now before the reader, and many others which
have probably amused and delighted him, must be excluded:
a definition like this will be found in the words which the
greatest of poets, not divinely inspired, has given to the most
noble and valiant Duke of Athens&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem2"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“The poet’s eye, in a fine frenzy rolling,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as Imagination bodies forth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The forms of things unknown, the poet’s pen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turns them to shapes, and gives to airy nothing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A local habitation, and a name<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>.”<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Hence we observe the poet is one who, in the excursions of
his fancy between heaven and earth, lights upon a kind of fairyland,
in which he places a creation of his own, where he
embodies shapes, and gives action and adventure to his ideal
offspring; taking captive the imagination of his readers, he
elevates them above the grossness of actual being, into the
soothing and pleasant atmosphere of supra-mundane existence:
there he obtains for his visionary inhabitants the interest that
engages a reader’s attention without ruffling his feelings, and
excites that moderate kind of sympathy which the realities of
nature oftentimes fail to produce, either because they are so
familiar and insignificant that they excite no determinate
emotion, or are so harsh and powerful that the feelings excited
are grating and distasteful.</p>

<p>Be it then granted that (as Duke Theseus observes) “such
tricks hath strong Imagination,” and that such poets “are of
imagination all compact;” let it be further conceded, that theirs
is a higher and more dignified kind of composition, nay, the
only kind that has pretensions to inspiration: still, that these
poets should so entirely engross the title as to exclude those who
address their productions to the plain sense and sober judgment
of their readers, rather than to their fancy and imagination,
I must repeat that I am unwilling to admit&mdash;because I conceive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
that, by granting such right of exclusion, a vast deal of what has
been hitherto received as genuine poetry would no longer be
entitled to that appellation.</p>

<p>All that kind of satire wherein character is skillfully delineated
must (this criterion being allowed) no longer be esteemed as
genuine poetry; and for the same reason many affecting
narratives which are founded on real events, and borrow no aid
whatever from the imagination of the writer, must likewise be
rejected: a considerable part of the poems, as they have hitherto
been denominated, of Chaucer, are of this naked and unveiled
character; and there are in his Tales many pages of coarse,
accurate, and minute, but very striking description. Many
small poems in a subsequent age, of most impressive kind, are
adapted and addressed to the common sense of the reader, and
prevail by the strong language of truth and nature; they
amused our ancestors, and they continue to engage our interest,
and excite our feelings, by the same powerful appeals to the
heart and affections. In times less remote, Dryden has given
us much of this poetry, in which the force of expression and
accuracy of description have neither needed nor obtained
assistance from the fancy of the writer; the characters in his
Absalom and Achitophel are instances of this, and more
especially those of Doeg and Og in the second part: these,
with all their grossness, and almost offensive accuracy, are found
to possess that strength and spirit which has preserved from
utter annihilation the dead bodies of Tate, to whom they were
inhumanly bound, happily with a fate the reverse of that caused
by the cruelty of Mezentius; for there the living perished in
the putrefaction of the dead, and here the dead are preserved by
the vitality of the living. And, to bring forward one other
example, it will be found that Pope himself has no small portion
of this actuality of relation, this nudity of description, and
poetry without an atmosphere; the lines beginning, “In the
worst inn’s worst room,” are an example, and many others may be
seen in his Satires, Imitations, and above all in his Dunciad:
the frequent absence of those “Sports of Fancy,” and “Tricks
of strong Imagination,” have been so much observed, that some
have ventured to question whether even this writer were
a poet; and though, as Dr. Johnson has remarked, it would be
difficult to form a definition of one in which Pope should not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
be admitted, yet they who doubted his claim, had, it is likely,
provided for his exclusion by forming that kind of character for
their poet, in which this elegant versifier, for so he must be then
named, should not be comprehended.</p>

<p>These things considered, an author will find comfort in his
expulsion from the rank and society of poets, by reflecting that
men much his superiors were likewise shut out, and more
especially when he finds also that men not much his superiors
are entitled to admission.</p>

<p>But in whatever degree I may venture to differ from any
others in my notions of the qualifications and character of the
true poet, I most cordially assent to their opinion who assert
that his principal exertions must be made to engage the attention
of his readers; and further, I must allow that the effect of
poetry should be to lift the mind from the painful realities of
actual existence, from its every-day concerns, and its perpetually
occurring vexations, and to give it repose by substituting objects
in their place which it may contemplate with some degree of
interest and satisfaction; but what is there in all this, which
may not be effected by a fair representation of existing character?
nay, by a faithful delineation of those painful realities, those
every-day concerns, and those perpetually-occurring vexations
themselves, provided they be not (which is hardly to be supposed)
the very concerns and distresses of the reader? for, when it is
admitted that they have no particular relation to him, but are
the troubles and anxieties of other men, they excite and interest
his feelings as the imaginary exploits, adventures, and perils of
romance;&mdash;they soothe his mind, and keep his curiosity pleasantly
awake; they appear to have enough of reality to engage
his sympathy, but possess not interest sufficient to create painful
sensations. Fiction itself, we know, and every work of fancy,
must for a time have the effect of realities; nay, the very
enchanters, spirits, and monsters of Ariosto and Spenser must
be present in the mind of the reader while he is engaged by
their operations, or they would be as the objects and incidents
of a nursery tale to a rational understanding, altogether despised
and neglected: in truth, I can but consider this pleasant effect
upon the mind of a reader as depending neither upon the events
related (whether they be actual or imaginary), nor upon the
characters introduced (whether taken from life or fancy), but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
upon the manner in which the poem itself is conducted; let
that be judiciously managed, and the occurrences actually copied
from life will have the same happy effect as the inventions of
a creative fancy;&mdash;while, on the other hand, the imaginary
persons and incidents to which the poet has given “a local
habitation, and a name,” will make upon the concurring feelings
of the reader the same impressions with those taken from truth
and nature, because they will appear to be derived from that
source, and therefore of necessity will have a similar effect.</p>

<p>Having thus far presumed to claim for the ensuing pages the
rank and title of poetry, I attempt no more, nor venture to class
or compare them with any other kinds of poetical composition;
their place will doubtless be found for them.</p>

<p>A principal view and wish of the poet must be to engage
the mind of his readers, as, failing in that point, he will scarcely
succeed in any other: I therefore willingly confess that much
of my time and assiduity has been devoted to this purpose; but,
to the ambition of pleasing, no other sacrifices have, I trust,
been made, than of my own labour and care. Nothing will be
found that militates against the rules of propriety and good
manners, nothing that offends against the more important
precepts of morality and religion; and with this negative kind
of merit, I commit my book to the judgment and taste of the
reader&mdash;not being willing to provoke his vigilance by professions
of accuracy, nor to solicit his indulgence by apologies for mistakes.</p>

<span class="i0">Here will men say, “We heard, at such an hour,</span>

<span class="i2">Inquiry made, he found that day would meet</span>
<span class="i0">A learned club, and in the very street:</span>
<span class="i0">Knowledge to gain and give, was the design; <span class="linenum">110</span></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
<span class="i0">To speak, to hearken, to debate, and dine:</span>

<span class="i0">In either way, to eat or to discourse.</span>
<span class="i2">Nothing more easy than to gain access</span>
<span class="i0">To men like these, with his polite address:</span>
<span class="i0">So he succeeded, and first look’d around,</span>

<span class="i0">And therefore silent chose awhile to sit,</span>
<span class="i0">Then enter boldly by some lucky hit,</span>
<span class="i0">Some observation keen or stroke severe, <span class="linenum">120</span></span>
<span class="i0">To cause some wonder or excite some fear.</span>
<span class="i2">Now, dinner past, no longer he suppress’d</span>
<span class="i0">His strong dislike to be a silent guest;</span>
<span class="i0">Subjects and words were now at his command&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">When disappointment frown’d on all he plann’d;</span>
<span class="i0">For, hark!&mdash;he heard, amazed, on every side,</span>
<span class="i0">His church insulted and her priests belied;</span>
<span class="i0">The laws reviled, the ruling power abused,</span>
<span class="i0">The land derided, and its foes excused:&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">He heard and ponder’d.&mdash;What, to men so vile, <span class="linenum">130</span></span>
<span class="i0">Should be his language? For his threat’ning style</span>

<span class="i0">He now sat lost, perplex’d, astonish’d, still.</span>
<span class="i2">Here were Socinians, Deists, and indeed<span class="ws11">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">All who, as foes to England’s church, agreed;<span class="ws9">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">But still with creeds unlike, and some without a creed:&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">Here, too, fierce friends of liberty he saw,</span>
<span class="i0">Who own’d no prince and who obey no law; <span class="linenum">140</span></span>
<span class="i0">There were Reformers of each different sort,</span>
<span class="i0">Foes to the laws, the priesthood, and the court;</span>
<span class="i0">Some on their favourite plans alone intent,</span>
<span class="i0">Some purely angry and malevolent:</span>
<span class="i0">The rash were proud to blame their country’s laws;</span>
<span class="i0">The vain, to seem supporters of a cause;</span>
<span class="i0">One call’d for change that he would dread to see;</span>
<span class="i0">Another sigh’d for Gallic liberty!</span>
<span class="i0">And numbers joining with the forward crew,</span>
<span class="i0">For no one reason&mdash;but that numbers do.  <span class="linenum">150</span></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
<span class="i2">“How,” said the Justice, “can this trouble rise,</span>
<span class="i0">This shame and pain, from creatures I despise?”</span>
<span class="i0">And conscience answer’d&mdash;“The prevailing cause</span>
<span class="i0">Is thy delight in listening to applause;</span>
<span class="i0">Here, thou art seated with a tribe, who spurn</span>
<span class="i0">Thy favourite themes, and into laughter turn</span>
<span class="i0">Thy fears and wishes; silent and obscure,</span>
<span class="i0">Thyself, shalt thou the long harangue endure;</span>
<span class="i0">And learn, by feeling, what it is to force</span>
<span class="i0">On thy unwilling friends the long discourse. <span class="linenum">160</span></span>
<span class="i0">What though thy thoughts be just, and these, it seems,</span>
<span class="i0">Are traitors’ projects, idiots’ empty schemes:</span>
<span class="i0">Yet minds like bodies cramm’d, reject their food,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor will be forced and tortured for their good!”</span>
<span class="i2">At length, a sharp, shrewd, sallow man arose,</span>
<span class="i0">And begg’d he briefly might his mind disclose;</span>
<span class="i0">“It was his duty, in these worst of times,</span>
<span class="i0">T’ inform the govern’d of their rulers’ crimes.”</span>
<span class="i0">This pleasant subject to attend, they each</span>
<span class="i0">Prepared to listen, and forbore to teach. <span class="linenum">170</span></span>
<span class="i2">Then, voluble and fierce, the wordy man</span>
<span class="i0">Through a long chain of favourite horrors ran:&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">First, of the church, from whose enslaving power</span>
<span class="i0">He was deliver’d, and he bless’d the hour;</span>
<span class="i0">“Bishops and deans, and prebendaries all,”</span>
<span class="i0">He said, “were cattle fatt’ning in the stall;</span>
<span class="i0">Slothful and pursy, insolent and mean,</span>
<span class="i0">Were every bishop, prebendary, dean,</span>
<span class="i0">And wealthy rector; curates, poorly paid,</span>
<span class="i0">Were only dull;&mdash;he would not them upbraid.” <span class="linenum">180</span></span>
<span class="i2">From priests he turn’d to canons, creeds, and prayers,</span>
<span class="i0">Rubrics and rules, and all our church affairs;</span>
<span class="i0">Churches themselves, desk, pulpit, altar, all</span>
<span class="i0">The Justice reverenced&mdash;and pronounced their fall.</span>
<span class="i2">Then from religion Hammond turn’d his view,</span>
<span class="i0">To give our rulers the correction due;</span>
<span class="i0">Not one wise action had these triflers plann’d;</span>
<span class="i0">There was, it seem’d, no wisdom in the land;</span>
<span class="i0">Save in this patriot tribe, who meet at times</span>
<span class="i0">To show the statesman’s errors and his crimes. <span class="linenum">190</span></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
<span class="i2">Now here was Justice Bolt compell’d to sit,</span>
<span class="i0">To hear the deist’s scorn, the rebel’s wit;</span>
<span class="i0">The fact mis-stated, the envenom’d lie,</span>
<span class="i0">And staring, spell-bound, made not one reply.</span>
<span class="i2">Then were our laws abused&mdash;and with the laws,</span>
<span class="i0">All who prepare, defend, or judge a cause:</span>
<span class="i0">“We have no lawyer whom a man can trust,”</span>
<span class="i0">Proceeded Hammond&mdash;“if the laws were just;</span>
<span class="i0">But they are evil; ’tis the savage state</span>
<span class="i0">Is only good, and ours sophisticate! <span class="linenum">200</span></span>
<span class="i0">See! the free creatures in their woods and plains,</span>
<span class="i0">Where without laws each happy monarch reigns,</span>
<span class="i0">King of himself&mdash;while we a number dread,</span>
<span class="i0">By slaves commanded and by dunces led;</span>
<span class="i0">Oh, let the name with either state agree&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Savage our own we’ll name, and civil theirs shall be.”</span>
<span class="i2">The silent Justice still astonish’d sate,</span>
<span class="i0">And wonder’d much whom he was gazing at;</span>
<span class="i0">Twice he essay’d to speak&mdash;but in a cough</span>
<span class="i0">The faint, indignant, dying speech went off: <span class="linenum">210</span></span>
<span class="i0">“But who is this?” thought he&mdash;“a dæmon vile,</span>
<span class="i0">With wicked meaning and a vulgar style:</span>
<span class="i0">Hammond they call him; they can give the name</span>
<span class="i0">Of man to devils.&mdash;Why am I so tame?</span>
<span class="i0">Why crush I not the viper?”&mdash;Fear replied,</span>
<span class="i0">“Watch him awhile, and let his strength be tried;</span>
<span class="i0">He will be foil’d, if man; but if his aid</span>
<span class="i0">Be from beneath, ’tis well to be afraid.”</span>
<span class="i2">“We are call’d free!” said Hammond&mdash;“doleful times</span>
<span class="i0">When rulers add their insult to their crimes; <span class="linenum">220</span></span>
<span class="i0">For, should our scorn expose each powerful vice,</span>
<span class="i0">It would be libel, and we pay the price.”</span>
<span class="i2">Thus with licentious words the man went on,</span>
<span class="i0">Proving that liberty of speech was gone;</span>
<span class="i0">That all were slaves&mdash;nor had we better chance</span>
<span class="i0">For better times than as allies to France.</span>
<span class="i2">Loud groan’d the stranger&mdash;Why, he must relate,</span>
<span class="i0">And own’d, “In sorrow for his country’s fate.”</span>
<span class="i0">“Nay, she were safe,” the ready man replied,</span>
<span class="i0">“Might patriots rule her, and could reasoners guide; <span class="linenum">230</span></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
<span class="i0">When all to vote, to speak, to teach, are free,</span>
<span class="i0">Whate’er their creeds or their opinions be;</span>
<span class="i0">When books of statutes are consumed in flames,</span>
<span class="i0">And courts and copyholds are empty names;</span>
<span class="i0">Then will be times of joy&mdash;but ere they come,</span>
<span class="i0">Havock, and war, and blood must be our doom.”</span>
<span class="i2">The man here paused&mdash;then loudly for reform</span>
<span class="i0">He call’d, and hail’d the prospect of the storm;</span>
<span class="i0">The wholesome blast, the fertilizing flood&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Peace gain’d by tumult, plenty bought with blood:  <span class="linenum">240</span></span>
<span class="i0">Sharp means, he own’d; but when the land’s disease</span>
<span class="i0">Asks cure complete, no med’cines are like these.</span>
<span class="i2">Our Justice now, more led by fear than rage,</span>
<span class="i0">Saw it in vain with madness to engage;</span>
<span class="i0">With imps of darkness no man seeks to fight,</span>
<span class="i0">Knaves to instruct, or set deceivers right.</span>
<span class="i0">Then, as the daring speech denounced these woes,</span>
<span class="i0">Sick at the soul, the grieving guest arose;</span>
<span class="i0">Quick on the board his ready cash he threw,</span>
<span class="i0">And from the dæmons to his closet flew. <span class="linenum">250</span></span>
<span class="i0">There when secured, he pray’d with earnest zeal,</span>
<span class="i0">That all they wish’d these patriot-souls might feel;</span>
<span class="i0">“Let them to France, their darling country, haste,</span>
<span class="i0">And all the comforts of a Frenchman taste;</span>

<span class="i2">Home came our hero, to forget no more</span>
<span class="i0">The fear he felt and ever most deplore:</span>
<span class="i0">For, though he quickly join’d his friends again,</span>
<span class="i0">And could with decent force his themes maintain,</span>
<span class="i0">Still it occurr’d that, in a luckless time,</span>
<span class="i0">He fail’d to fight with heresy and crime; <span class="linenum">270</span></span>
<span class="i0">It was observed his words were not so strong,</span>
<span class="i0">His tones so powerful, his harangues so long,</span>
<span class="i0">As in old times&mdash;for he would often drop</span>
<span class="i0">The lofty look, and of a sudden stop;</span>
<span class="i0">When conscience whisper’d, that he once was still,</span>
<span class="i0">And let the wicked triumph at their will;</span>
<span class="i0">And therefore now, when not a foe was near,</span>
<span class="i0">He had no right so valiant to appear.</span>
<span class="i2">Some years had pass’d, and he perceived his fears</span>
<span class="i0">Yield to the spirit of his earlier years&mdash;  <span class="linenum">280</span></span>
<span class="i0">When at a meeting, with his friends beside,</span>
<span class="i0">He saw an object that awaked his pride;</span>
<span class="i0">His shame, wrath, vengeance, indignation&mdash;all</span>
<span class="i0">Man’s harsher feelings did that sight recall.</span>
<span class="i2">For lo! beneath him fix’d, our man of law</span>
<span class="i0">That lawless man the foe of order saw&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Once fear’d, now scorn’d; once dreaded, now abhorr’d;</span>
<span class="i0">A wordy man, and evil every word.</span>
<span class="i0">Again he gazed&mdash;“It is,” said he, “the same;</span>

<span class="i0">So thought our hero, who each instant found</span>
<span class="i0">His courage rising, from the numbers round.</span>
<span class="i2">As when a felon has escaped and fled,</span>
<span class="i0">So long, that law conceives the culprit dead;</span>

<span class="i0">Till she beholds him in a place, where none</span>

<span class="i0">There he sits upright in his seat, secure,</span>
<span class="i0">As one whose conscience is correct and pure;  <span class="linenum">300</span></span>
<span class="i0">This rouses anger for the old offence,</span>

<span class="i2">Hammond, much praised by numerous friends, was come</span>

<span class="i0">Here, he had heard, that numbers had design,</span>

<span class="i0">Not this avail’d him, when he cast his eye</span>
<span class="i0">On Justice Bolt; he could not fight, nor fly.</span>

<span class="i0">He wonder’d who his right-hand man might be&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Vicar of Holt cum Uppingham was he;</span>
<span class="i0">And who the man of that dark frown possess’d&mdash; <span class="linenum">350</span></span>
<span class="i0">Rector of Bradley and of Barton-west;</span>
<span class="i0">“A pluralist,” he growl’d&mdash;but check’d the word,</span>
<span class="i0">That warfare might not, by his zeal, be stirr’d.</span>
<span class="i2">But now began the man above to show</span>
<span class="i0">Fierce looks and threat’nings to the man below;</span>
<span class="i0">Who had some thoughts his peace by flight to seek&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">But how then lecture, if he dared not speak!&mdash;</span>
<span class="i2">Now as the Justice for the war prepared,</span>
<span class="i0">He seem’d just then to question if he dared:</span>
<span class="i0">“He may resist, although his power be small,  <span class="linenum">360</span></span>
<span class="i0">And growing desperate may defy us all;</span>
<span class="i0">One dog attack, and he prepares for flight&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Resist another, and he strives to bite;</span>
<span class="i0">Nor can I say, if this rebellious cur</span>
<span class="i0">Will fly for safety, or will scorn to stir.”</span>
<span class="i0">Alarm’d by this, he lash’d his soul to rage,</span>
<span class="i0">Burn’d with strong shame, and hurried to engage.</span>
<span class="i2">As a male turkey straggling on the green,</span>
<span class="i0">When by fierce harriers, terriers, mongrels seen,</span>
<span class="i0">He feels the insult of the noisy train,   <span class="linenum">370</span></span>
<span class="i0">And sculks aside, though moved by much disdain;</span>
<span class="i0">But when that turkey, at his own barn-door,</span>
<span class="i0">Sees one poor straying puppy and no more,</span>
<span class="i0">(A foolish puppy who had left the pack,</span>
<span class="i0">Thoughtless what foe was threat’ning at his back,)</span>
<span class="i0">He moves about, as ship prepared to sail,</span>
<span class="i0">He hoists his proud rotundity of tail,</span>
<span class="i0">The half-seal’d eyes and changeful neck he shows,</span>
<span class="i0">Where, in its quick’ning colours, vengeance glows;</span>
<span class="i0">From red to blue the pendant wattles turn, <span class="linenum">380</span></span>
<span class="i0">Blue mix’d with red, as matches when they burn;</span>
<span class="i0">And thus th’ intruding snarler to oppose,</span>
<span class="i0">Urged by enkindling wrath, he gobbling goes.</span>
<span class="i2">So look’d our hero in his wrath, his cheeks</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Flush’d with fresh fires and glow’d in tingling streaks;</span>
<span class="i0">His breath by passion’s force awhile restrain’d,</span>
<span class="i0">Like a stopp’d current, greater force regain’d;</span>
<span class="i0">So spoke, so look’d he, every eye and ear</span>
<span class="i0">Were fix’d to view him, or were turn’d to hear.</span>
<span class="i2">“My friends, you know me, you can witness all, <span class="linenum">390</span></span>
<span class="i0">How, urged by passion, I restrain my gall;</span>
<span class="i0">And every motive to revenge withstand&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Save when I hear abused my native land.</span>
<span class="i2">“Is it not known, agreed, confirm’d, confess’d,</span>
<span class="i0">That of all people, we are govern’d best?</span>
<span class="i0">We have the force of monarchies; are free,</span>
<span class="i0">As the most proud republicans can be;</span>
<span class="i0">And have those prudent counsels that arise</span>
<span class="i0">In grave and cautious aristocracies;</span>
<span class="i0">And live there those, in such all-glorious state, <span class="linenum">400</span></span>
<span class="i0">Traitors protected in the land they hate?</span>
<span class="i0">Rebels, still warring with the laws that give</span>
<span class="i0">To them subsistence?&mdash;Yes, such wretches live.</span>
<span class="i2">“Ours is a church reform’d, and now no more</span>
<span class="i0">Is aught for man to mend or to restore;</span>
<span class="i0">’Tis pure in doctrines, ’tis correct in creeds,</span>
<span class="i0">Has nought redundant, and it nothing needs;</span>
<span class="i0">No evil is therein&mdash;no wrinkle, spot,</span>
<span class="i0">Stain, blame, or blemish:&mdash;I affirm there’s not.</span>
<span class="i2">“All this you know&mdash;now mark what once befell, <span class="linenum">410</span></span>
<span class="i0">With grief I bore it, and with shame I tell;</span>
<span class="i0">I was entrapp’d&mdash;yes, so it came to pass,</span>
<span class="i0">’Mid heathen rebels, a tumultuous class;</span>
<span class="i0">Each to his country bore a hellish mind,</span>
<span class="i0">Each like his neighbour was of cursèd kind;</span>
<span class="i0">The land that nursed them they blasphemed; the laws,</span>
<span class="i0">Their sovereign’s glory, and their country’s cause;</span>
<span class="i0">And who their mouth, their master-fiend, and who</span>
<span class="i0">Rebellion’s oracle?&mdash;&mdash;You, caitiff, you!”</span>
<span class="i2">He spoke, and standing stretch’d his mighty arm, <span class="linenum">420</span></span>
<span class="i0">And fix’d the man of words, as by a charm.</span>
<span class="i2">“How raved that railer! Sure some hellish power</span>
<span class="i0">Restrain’d my tongue in that delirious hour,</span>
<span class="i0">Or I had hurl’d the shame and vengeance due</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
<span class="i0">On him, the guide of that infuriate crew;</span>
<span class="i0">But to mine eyes such dreadful looks appear’d,</span>
<span class="i0">Such mingled yell of lying words I heard,</span>
<span class="i0">That I conceived around were dæmons all,</span>
<span class="i0">And till I fled the house, I fear’d its fall.</span>
<span class="i2">“Oh! could our country from our coasts expel <span class="linenum">430</span></span>
<span class="i0">Such foes! to nourish those who wish her well:</span>
<span class="i0">This her mild laws forbid, but we may still</span>
<span class="i0">From us eject them by our sovereign will;</span>
<span class="i0">This let us do.”&mdash;He said, and then began</span>
<span class="i0">A gentler feeling for the silent man;</span>
<span class="i0">Ev’n in our hero’s mighty soul arose</span>
<span class="i0">A touch of pity for experienced woes;</span>
<span class="i0">But this was transient, and with angry eye</span>
<span class="i0">He sternly look’d, and paused for a reply.</span>
<span class="i2">’Twas then the man of many words would speak&mdash; <span class="linenum">440</span></span>
<span class="i0">But, in his trial, had them all to seek:</span>
<span class="i0">To find a friend he look’d the circle round,</span>
<span class="i0">But joy or scorn in every feature found;</span>
<span class="i0">He sipp’d his wine, but in those times of dread</span>
<span class="i0">Wine only adds confusion to the head;</span>
<span class="i0">In doubt he reason’d with himself&mdash;“And how</span>
<span class="i0">Harangue at night, if I be silent now?”</span>
<span class="i0">From pride and praise received he sought to draw</span>
<span class="i0">Courage to speak, but still remain’d the awe;</span>
<span class="i0">One moment rose he with a forced disdain,  <span class="linenum">450</span></span>
<span class="i0">And then, abash’d, sunk sadly down again;</span>
<span class="i0">While in our hero’s glance he seem’d to read,</span>
<span class="i0">“Slave and insurgent! what hast thou to plead?”&mdash;</span>
<span class="i2">By desperation urged, he now began:</span>
<span class="i0">“I seek no favour&mdash;I&mdash;the Rights of Man!</span>
<span class="i0">Claim; and I&mdash;nay!&mdash;but give me leave&mdash;and I</span>
<span class="i0">Insist&mdash;a man&mdash;that is&mdash;and, in reply,</span>
<span class="i0">I speak.”&mdash;Alas! each new attempt was vain:</span>
<span class="i0">Confused he stood, he sate, he rose again;</span>
<span class="i0">At length he growl’d defiance, sought the door,  <span class="linenum">460</span></span>
<span class="i0">Cursed the whole synod, and was seen no more.</span>
<span class="i2">“Laud we,” said Justice Bolt, “the Powers above;</span>
<span class="i0">Thus could our speech the sturdiest foe remove.”</span>
<span class="i0">Exulting now he gain’d new strength of fame,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And lost all feelings of defeat and shame.</span>
<span class="i2">“He dared not strive, you witness’d&mdash;dared not lift</span>
<span class="i0">His voice, nor drive at his accursed drift:</span>
<span class="i0">So all shall tremble, wretches who oppose</span>
<span class="i0">Our church or state&mdash;thus be it to our foes.”</span>
<span class="i2">He spoke, and, seated with his former air, <span class="linenum">470</span></span>
<span class="i0">Look’d his full self, and fill’d his ample chair;</span>
<span class="i0">Took one full bumper to each favourite cause, <span class="ws12">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And dwelt all night on politics and laws,<span class="ws17">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">With high applauding voice, that gain’d him high applause.&emsp;}</span>

<span class="i0">Minutely trace man’s life; year after year,</span>
<span class="i0">Through all his days let all his deeds appear,</span>
<span class="i0">And then, though some may in that life be strange,</span>
<span class="i0">Yet there appears no vast nor sudden change;</span>
<span class="i0">The links that bind those various deeds are seen,</span>
<span class="i0">And no mysterious void is left between.</span>
<span class="i2">But let these binding links be all destroy’d,</span>
<span class="i0">All that through years he suffer’d or enjoy’d;</span>
<span class="i0">Let that vast gap be made, and then behold&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">This was the youth, and he is thus when old; <span class="linenum">10</span></span>
<span class="i0">Then we at once the work of Time survey,</span>
<span class="i0">And in an instant see a life’s decay:</span>
<span class="i0">Pain[s] mix’d with pity in our bosoms rise,</span>
<span class="i0">And sorrow takes new sadness from surprise.</span>
<span class="i2">Beneath yon tree, observe an ancient pair&mdash;&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">A sleeping man; a woman in her chair,<span class="ws8">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Watching his looks with kind and pensive air;&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">No wife, nor sister she, nor is the name</span>
<span class="i0">Nor kindred of this friendly pair the same;</span>
<span class="i0">Yet so allied are they, that few can feel <span class="linenum">20</span></span>
<span class="i0">Her constant, warm, unwearied, anxious zeal,</span>
<span class="i0">Their years and woes, although they long have loved,</span>
<span class="i0">Keep their good name and conduct unreproved;</span>
<span class="i0">Thus life’s small comforts they together share,</span>
<span class="i0">And while life lingers for the grave prepare.</span>
<span class="i2">No other subjects on their spirits press,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor gain such int’rest as the past distress;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Grievous events that from the mem’ry drive</span>
<span class="i0">Life’s common cares, and those alone survive,</span>
<span class="i0">Mix with each thought, in every action share, <span class="linenum">30</span></span>
<span class="i0">Darken each dream, and blend with every prayer.</span>
<span class="i2">To David Booth, his fourth and last-born boy,</span>
<span class="i0">Allen his name, was more than common joy;</span>
<span class="i0">And as the child grew up, there seem’d in him</span>
<span class="i0">A more than common life in every limb;</span>
<span class="i0">A strong and handsome stripling he became,</span>
<span class="i0">And the gay spirit answer’d to the frame;</span>
<span class="i0">A lighter, happier lad was never seen,</span>
<span class="i0">For ever easy, cheerful, or serene;</span>
<span class="i0">His early love he fix’d upon a fair <span class="linenum">40</span></span>
<span class="i0">And gentle maid&mdash;they were a handsome pair.</span>
<span class="i2">They at an infant-school together play’d,</span>
<span class="i0">Where the foundation of their love was laid;</span>
<span class="i0">The boyish champion would his choice attend</span>
<span class="i0">In every sport, in every fray defend.</span>
<span class="i0">As prospects open’d and as life advanced,</span>
<span class="i0">They walk’d together, they together danced;</span>
<span class="i0">On all occasions, from their early years,</span>
<span class="i0">They mix’d their joys and sorrows, hopes and fears;</span>
<span class="i0">Each heart was anxious, till it could impart <span class="linenum">50</span></span>
<span class="i0">Its daily feelings to its kindred heart;</span>
<span class="i0">As years increased, unnumber’d petty wars</span>
<span class="i0">Broke out between them; jealousies and jars;</span>
<span class="i0">Causeless indeed, and follow’d by a peace,</span>
<span class="i0">That gave to love&mdash;growth, vigour, and increase.</span>
<span class="i0">Whilst yet a boy, when other minds are void,</span>
<span class="i0">Domestic thoughts young Allen’s hours employ’d;</span>
<span class="i0">Judith in gaining hearts had no concern,</span>
<span class="i0">Rather intent the matron’s part to learn;</span>
<span class="i0">Thus early prudent and sedate they grew, <span class="linenum">60</span></span>
<span class="i0">While lovers, thoughtful&mdash;and, though children, true.</span>
<span class="i0">To either parents not a day appear’d,</span>
<span class="i0">When with this love they might have interfered:</span>
<span class="i0">Childish at first, they cared not to restrain;</span>
<span class="i0">And strong at last, they saw restriction vain;</span>
<span class="i0">Nor knew they when that passion to reprove&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Now idle fondness, now resistless love.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
<span class="i2">So, while the waters rise, the children tread</span>
<span class="i0">On the broad estuary’s sandy bed;</span>
<span class="i0">But soon the channel fills, from side to side <span class="linenum">70</span></span>
<span class="i0">Comes danger rolling with the deep’ning tide;</span>
<span class="i0">Yet none who saw the rapid current flow</span>
<span class="i0">Could the first instant of that danger know.</span>
<span class="i2">The lovers waited till the time should come</span>
<span class="i0">When they together could possess a home:</span>
<span class="i0">In either house were men and maids unwed,</span>
<span class="i0">Hopes to be soothed, and tempers to be led.</span>
<span class="i0">Then Allen’s mother of his favourite maid</span>
<span class="i0">Spoke from the feelings of a mind afraid:</span>
<span class="i0">“Dress and amusements were her sole employ,” <span class="linenum">80</span></span>
<span class="i0">She said&mdash;“entangling her deluded boy;”</span>
<span class="i0">And yet, in truth, a mother’s jealous love</span>
<span class="i0">Had much imagined and could little prove;</span>
<span class="i0">Judith had beauty&mdash;and, if vain, was kind,</span>
<span class="i0">Discreet, and mild, and had a serious mind.</span>
<span class="i2">Dull was their prospect&mdash;when the lovers met,</span>
<span class="i0">They said, we must not&mdash;dare not venture yet:</span>
<span class="i0">“Oh! could I labour for thee,” Allen cried,</span>
<span class="i0">“Why should our friends be thus dissatisfied?</span>
<span class="i0">On my own arm I could depend, but they<span class="ws11">}</span><span class="linenum">90</span></span>
<span class="i0">Still urge obedience&mdash;must I yet obey?”<span class="ws12">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Poor Judith felt the grief, but grieving begg’d delay. &emsp;}</span>
<span class="i2">At length a prospect came that seem’d to smile,</span>
<span class="i0">And faintly woo them, from a Western Isle.</span>
<span class="i0">A kinsman there a widow’s hand had gain’d,</span>
<span class="i0">“Was old, was rich, and childless yet remain’d;</span>
<span class="i0">Would some young Booth to his affairs attend,</span>
<span class="i0">And wait awhile, he might expect a friend.”</span>
<span class="i0">The elder brothers, who were not in love,</span>
<span class="i0">Fear’d the false seas, unwilling to remove; <span class="linenum">100</span></span>
<span class="i0">But the young Allen, an enamour’d boy,</span>
<span class="i0">Eager an independence to enjoy,</span>
<span class="i0">Would through all perils seek it&mdash;by the sea&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Through labour, danger, pain, or slavery.</span>
<span class="i0">The faithful Judith his design approved;</span>
<span class="i0">For both were sanguine, they were young and loved.</span>
<span class="i0">The mother’s slow consent was then obtain’d;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The time arrived, to part alone remain’d.</span>
<span class="i0">All things prepared, on the expected day</span>
<span class="i0">Was seen the vessel anchor’d in the bay. <span class="linenum">110</span></span>
<span class="i0">From her would seamen in the evening come,</span>
<span class="i0">To take th’ advent’rous Allen from his home;</span>
<span class="i0">With his own friends the final day he pass’d,</span>
<span class="i0">And every painful hour, except the last.</span>
<span class="i0">The grieving father urged the cheerful glass,</span>
<span class="i0">To make the moments with less sorrow pass;</span>
<span class="i0">Intent the mother look’d upon her son,</span>
<span class="i0">And wish’d th’ assent withdrawn, the deed undone;</span>
<span class="i0">The younger sister, as he took his way,</span>
<span class="i0">Hung on his coat, and begg’d for more delay: <span class="linenum">120</span></span>
<span class="i0">But his own Judith call’d him to the shore,</span>
<span class="i0">Whom he must meet, for they might meet no more;&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">And there he found her&mdash;faithful, mournful, true,</span>
<span class="i0">Weeping and waiting for a last adieu!</span>
<span class="i0">The ebbing tide had left the sand, and there</span>
<span class="i0">Moved with slow steps the melancholy pair:</span>
<span class="i0">Sweet were the painful moments&mdash;but how sweet,</span>
<span class="i0">And without pain, when they again should meet!</span>
<span class="i0">Now either spoke, as hope and fear impress’d</span>
<span class="i0">Each their alternate triumph in the breast. <span class="linenum">130</span></span>
<span class="i2">Distance alarm’d the maid&mdash;she cried, “’Tis far!”</span>
<span class="i0">And danger too&mdash;“it is a time of war.</span>
<span class="i0">Then, in those countries are diseases strange,</span>
<span class="i0">And women gay, and men are prone to change;</span>
<span class="i0">What, then, may happen in a year, when things</span>
<span class="i0">Of vast importance every moment brings!</span>
<span class="i0">But hark! an oar!” she cried, yet none appear’d&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">’Twas love’s mistake, who fancied what it fear’d;</span>
<span class="i0">And she continued&mdash;“Do, my Allen, keep</span>
<span class="i0">Thy heart from evil, let thy passions sleep; <span class="linenum">140</span></span>
<span class="i0">Believe it good, nay glorious, to prevail,</span>
<span class="i0">And stand in safety where so many fail;</span>
<span class="i0">And do not, Allen, or for shame, or pride,</span>
<span class="i0">Thy faith abjure, or thy profession hide;</span>
<span class="i0">Can I believe <i>his</i> love will lasting prove,</span>
<span class="i0">Who has no rev’rence for the God I love?</span>
<span class="i0">I know thee well! how good thou art and kind;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But strong the passions that invade thy mind.&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Now, what to me hath Allen to commend?”&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“Upon my mother,” said the youth, “attend; <span class="linenum">150</span></span>
<span class="i0">Forget her spleen, and in my place appear;</span>
<span class="i0">Her love to me will make my Judith dear:</span>
<span class="i0">Oft I shall think (such comfort lovers seek),</span>
<span class="i0">Who speaks of me, and fancy what they speak;</span>
<span class="i0">Then write on all occasions, always dwell</span>
<span class="i0">On hope’s fair prospects, and be kind and well,</span>
<span class="i0">And ever choose the fondest, tenderest style.”</span>
<span class="i0">She answer’d, “No,” but answer’d with a smile.</span>
<span class="i0">“And now, my Judith, at so sad a time,</span>
<span class="i0">Forgive my fear, and call it not my crime; <span class="linenum">160</span></span>
<span class="i0">When with our youthful neighbours ’tis thy chance</span>
<span class="i0">To meet in walks, the visit or the dance,</span>
<span class="i0">When every lad would on my lass attend,</span>
<span class="i0">Choose not a smooth designer for a friend;</span>
<span class="i0">That fawning Philip!&mdash;nay, be not severe,</span>
<span class="i0">A rival’s hope must cause a lover’s fear.”</span>
<span class="i2">Displeased she felt, and might in her reply</span>
<span class="i0">Have mix’d some anger, but the boat was nigh,</span>
<span class="i0">Now truly heard!&mdash;it soon was full in sight;&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Now the sad farewell, and the long good-night; <span class="linenum">170</span></span>
<span class="i0">For, see!&mdash;his friends come hast’ning to the beach,</span>
<span class="i0">And now the gunwale is within the reach;</span>
<span class="i0">“Adieu!&mdash;farewell!&mdash;remember!”&mdash;and what more</span>
<span class="i0">Affection taught, was utter’d from the shore!</span>
<span class="i0">But Judith left them with a heavy heart,</span>
<span class="i0">Took a last view, and went to weep apart!</span>
<span class="i0">And now his friends went slowly from the place,</span>
<span class="i0">Where she stood still, the dashing oar to trace,</span>
<span class="i0">Till all were silent!&mdash;for the youth she pray’d,</span>
<span class="i0">And softly then return’d the weeping maid. <span class="linenum">180</span></span>
<span class="i2">They parted, thus by hope and fortune led,</span>
<span class="i0">And Judith’s hours in pensive pleasure fled.</span>
<span class="i0">But when return’d the youth?&mdash;the youth no more</span>
<span class="i0">Return’d exulting to his native shore.</span>
<span class="i0">But forty years were past, and then there came<span class="ws13">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">A worn-out man with wither’d limbs and lame, <span class="ws12">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">His mind oppress’d with woes, and bent with age his frame:&emsp;}</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Yes! old and grieved, and trembling with decay, <span class="ws9">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Was Allen landing in his native bay,<span class="ws19">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Willing his breathless form should blend with kindred clay. }</span>
<span class="i0">In an autumnal eve he left the beach, <span class="linenum">191</span></span>
<span class="i0">In such an eve he chanced the port to reach.</span>
<span class="i0">He was alone; he press’d the very place</span>
<span class="i0">Of the sad parting, of the last embrace:</span>
<span class="i0">There stood his parents, there retired the maid,</span>
<span class="i0">So fond, so tender, and so much afraid;</span>
<span class="i0">And on that spot, through many a year, his mind</span>
<span class="i0">Turn’d mournful back, half sinking, half resign’d.</span>
<span class="i2">No one was present; of its crew bereft,</span>
<span class="i0">A single boat was in the billows left; <span class="linenum">200</span></span>
<span class="i0">Sent from some anchor’d vessel in the bay,</span>
<span class="i0">At the returning tide to sail away.</span>
<span class="i0">O’er the black stern the moonlight softly play’d,</span>
<span class="i0">The loosen’d foresail flapping in the shade;</span>
<span class="i0">All silent else on shore; but from the town</span>
<span class="i0">A drowsy peal of distant bells came down;</span>
<span class="i0">From the tall houses here and there, a light</span>
<span class="i0">Served some confused remembrance to excite:</span>
<span class="i0">“There,” he observed, and new emotions felt,</span>
<span class="i0">“Was my first home&mdash;and yonder Judith dwelt; <span class="linenum">210</span></span>
<span class="i0">Dead! dead are all! I long&mdash;I fear to know,”</span>
<span class="i0">He said, and walk’d impatient, and yet slow.</span>
<span class="i2">Sudden there broke upon his grief a noise</span>
<span class="i0">Of merry tumult and of vulgar joys:</span>
<span class="i0">Seamen returning to their ship, were come,</span>
<span class="i0">With idle numbers straying from their home;</span>
<span class="i0">Allen among them mix’d, and in the old</span>
<span class="i0">Strove some familiar features to behold;</span>
<span class="i0">While fancy aided memory;&mdash;“Man! what cheer?”</span>
<span class="i0">A sailor cried; “Art thou at anchor here?” <span class="linenum">220</span></span>
<span class="i0">Faintly he answer’d, and then tried to trace</span>
<span class="i0">Some youthful features in some aged face;</span>
<span class="i0">A swarthy matron he beheld, and thought</span>
<span class="i0">She might unfold the very truths he sought;</span>
<span class="i0">Confused and trembling, he the dame address’d:</span>
<span class="i0">“The Booths! yet live they?” pausing and oppress’d;</span>
<span class="i0">Then spake again:&mdash;“Is there no ancient man,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
<span class="i0">David his name?&mdash;assist me, if you can.&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Flemmings there were&mdash;and Judith, doth she live?”</span>
<span class="i0">The woman gazed, nor could an answer give; <span class="linenum">230</span></span>
<span class="i0">Yet wond’ring stood, and all were silent by,</span>
<span class="i0">Feeling a strange and solemn sympathy.</span>
<span class="i0">The woman musing said&mdash;“She knew full well</span>
<span class="i0">Where the old people came at last to dwell;</span>
<span class="i0">They had a married daughter and a son,</span>
<span class="i0">But they were dead, and now remain’d not one.”</span>
<span class="i2">“Yes,” said an elder, who had paused intent</span>
<span class="i0">On days long past, “there was a sad event;&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">One of these Booths&mdash;it was my mother’s tale&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Here left his lass, I know not where to sail; <span class="linenum">240</span></span>
<span class="i0">She saw their parting, and observed the pain;</span>
<span class="i0">But never came th’ unhappy man again.”</span>
<span class="i0">“The ship was captured”&mdash;Allen meekly said,</span>
<span class="i0">“And what became of the forsaken maid?”</span>
<span class="i0">The woman answer’d: “I remember now,</span>
<span class="i0">She used to tell the lasses of her vow,</span>
<span class="i0">And of her lover’s loss, and I have seen</span>
<span class="i0">The gayest hearts grow sad where she has been;</span>
<span class="i0">Yet in her grief she married, and was made</span>
<span class="i0">Slave to a wretch, whom meekly she obey’d  <span class="linenum">250</span></span>
<span class="i0">And early buried&mdash;but I know no more.</span>
<span class="i0">And hark! our friends are hast’ning to the shore.”</span>
<span class="i2">Allen soon found a lodging in the town,</span>
<span class="i0">And walk’d, a man unnoticed, up and down.</span>
<span class="i0">This house, and this, he knew, and thought a face</span>
<span class="i0">He sometimes could among a number trace;</span>
<span class="i0">Of names remember’d there remain’d a few,</span>
<span class="i0">But of no favourites, and the rest were new;</span>
<span class="i0">A merchant’s wealth, when Allen went to sea,</span>
<span class="i0">Was reckon’d boundless.&mdash;Could he living be? <span class="linenum">260</span></span>
<span class="i0">Or lived his son? for one he had, the heir</span>
<span class="i0">To a vast business, and a fortune fair.</span>
<span class="i0">No! but that heir’s poor widow, from her shed,</span>
<span class="i0">With crutches went to take her dole of bread.</span>
<span class="i0">There was a friend whom he had left a boy,</span>
<span class="i0">With hope to sail the master of a hoy;</span>
<span class="i0">Him, after many a stormy day, he found</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
<span class="i0">With his great wish, his life’s whole purpose, crown’d.</span>
<span class="i0">This hoy’s proud captain look’d in Allen’s face;&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“Yours is, my friend,” said he, “a woful case; <span class="linenum">270</span></span>
<span class="i0">We cannot all succeed; I now command</span>
<span class="i0">The Betsy sloop, and am not much at land;</span>
<span class="i0">But when we meet, you shall your story tell</span>
<span class="i0">Of foreign parts&mdash;I bid you now farewell!”</span>
<span class="i2">Allen so long had left his native shore,</span>
<span class="i0">He saw but few whom he had seen before;</span>
<span class="i0">The older people, as they met him, cast</span>
<span class="i0">A pitying look, oft speaking as they pass’d:&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“The man is Allen Booth, and it appears</span>
<span class="i0">He dwelt among us in his early years; <span class="linenum">280</span></span>
<span class="i0">We see the name engraved upon the stones,</span>
<span class="i0">Where this poor wanderer means to lay his bones.”</span>
<span class="i0">Thus where he lived and loved&mdash;unhappy change!&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">He seems a stranger, and finds all are strange.</span>
<span class="i2">But now a widow, in a village near,</span>
<span class="i0">Chanced of the melancholy man to hear;</span>
<span class="i0">Old as she was, to Judith’s bosom came</span>
<span class="i0">Some strong emotions at the well-known name;</span>
<span class="i0">He was her much-loved Allen, she had stay’d</span>
<span class="i0">Ten troubled years, a sad afflicted maid; <span class="linenum">290</span></span>
<span class="i0">Then was she wedded, of his death assured,</span>
<span class="i0">And much of mis’ry in her lot endured;</span>
<span class="i0">Her husband died; her children sought their bread</span>
<span class="i0">In various places, and to her were dead.</span>
<span class="i0">The once fond lovers met; not grief nor age,</span>
<span class="i0">Sickness or pain, their hearts could disengage:</span>
<span class="i0">Each had immediate confidence; a friend</span>
<span class="i0">Both now beheld, on whom they might depend:</span>
<span class="i0">“Now is there one to whom I can express</span>
<span class="i0">My nature’s weakness and my soul’s distress.” <span class="linenum">300</span></span>
<span class="i0">Allen look’d up, and with impatient heart:&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“Let me not lose thee&mdash;never let us part;</span>
<span class="i0">So Heaven this comfort to my sufferings give,</span>
<span class="i0">It is not all distress to think and live.”</span>
<span class="i0">Thus Allen spoke&mdash;for time had not removed</span>
<span class="i0">The charms attach’d to one so fondly loved;</span>
<span class="i0">Who with more health, the mistress of their cot,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Labours to soothe the evils of his lot.</span>
<span class="i0">To her, to her alone, his various fate,</span>
<span class="i0">At various times, ’tis comfort to relate; <span class="linenum">310</span></span>
<span class="i0">And yet his sorrow she too loves to hear</span>
<span class="i0">What wrings her bosom, and compels the tear.</span>
<span class="i2">First he related how he left the shore,</span>
<span class="i0">Alarm’d with fears that they should meet no more;</span>
<span class="i0">Then, ere the ship had reach’d her purposed course,</span>
<span class="i0">They met and yielded to the Spanish force;</span>
<span class="i0">Then ’cross th’ Atlantic seas they bore their prey,</span>
<span class="i0">Who grieving landed from their sultry bay;</span>
<span class="i0">And, marching many a burning league, he found</span>
<span class="i0">Himself a slave upon a miner’s ground: <span class="linenum">320</span></span>
<span class="i0">There a good priest his native language spoke,</span>
<span class="i0">And gave some ease to his tormenting yoke;</span>
<span class="i0">Kindly advanced him in his master’s grace,</span>
<span class="i0">And he was station’d in an easier place.</span>
<span class="i0">There, hopeless ever to escape the land,</span>
<span class="i0">He to a Spanish maiden gave his hand;</span>
<span class="i0">In cottage shelter’d from the blaze of day</span>
<span class="i0">He saw his happy infants round him play;</span>
<span class="i0">Where summer shadows, made by lofty trees,</span>
<span class="i0">Waved o’er his seat, and soothed his reveries; <span class="linenum">330</span></span>
<span class="i0">E’en then he thought of England, nor could sigh,</span>
<span class="i0">But his fond Isabel demanded, “Why?”</span>
<span class="i0">Grieved by the story, she the sigh repaid,</span>
<span class="i0">And wept in pity for the English maid:</span>
<span class="i0">Thus twenty years were pass’d, and pass’d his views</span>
<span class="i0">Of further bliss, for he had wealth to lose.</span>
<span class="i0">His friend now dead, some foe had dared to paint</span>
<span class="i0">“His faith as tainted: he his spouse would taint;</span>
<span class="i0">Make all his children infidels, and found</span>
<span class="i0">An English heresy on Christian ground.” <span class="linenum">340</span></span>
<span class="i2">“Whilst I was poor,” said Allen, “none would care</span>
<span class="i0">What my poor notions of religion were;</span>
<span class="i0">None ask’d me whom I worshipp’d, how I pray’d,</span>
<span class="i0">If due obedience to the laws were paid:</span>
<span class="i0">My good adviser taught me to be still,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor to make converts had I power or will.</span>
<span class="i0">I preached no foreign doctrine to my wife,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And never mention’d Luther in my life;</span>
<span class="i0">I, all they said, say what they would, allow’d,</span>
<span class="i0">And when the fathers bade me bow, I bow’d; <span class="linenum">350</span></span>
<span class="i0">Their forms I follow’d, whether well or sick,</span>
<span class="i0">And was a most obedient Catholic.</span>
<span class="i0">But I had money, and these pastors found</span>
<span class="i0">My notions vague, heretical, unsound:</span>
<span class="i0">A wicked book they seized; the very Turk</span>
<span class="i0">Could not have read a more pernicious work;</span>
<span class="i0">To me pernicious, who if it were good</span>
<span class="i0">Or evil question’d not, nor understood:</span>
<span class="i0">Oh! had I little but the book possess’d,</span>
<span class="i0">I might have read it, and enjoy’d my rest.” <span class="linenum">360</span></span>
<span class="i2">Alas! poor Allen, through his wealth was seen</span>
<span class="i0">Crimes that by poverty conceal’d had been:</span>
<span class="i0">Faults that in dusty pictures rest unknown</span>
<span class="i0">Are in an instant through the varnish shown.</span>
<span class="i2">He told their cruel mercy: how at last,</span>
<span class="i0">In Christian kindness for the merits past,</span>
<span class="i0">They spared his forfeit life, but bade him fly,</span>
<span class="i0">Or for his crime and contumacy die;</span>
<span class="i0">Fly from all scenes, all objects of delight; <span class="ws10">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">His wife, his children, weeping in his sight,<span class="ws9">}</span><span class="linenum">370</span></span>
<span class="i0">All urging him to flee, he fled, and cursed his flight.&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i2">He next related how he found a way,</span>
<span class="i0">Guideless and grieving, to Campeachy Bay:</span>
<span class="i0">There in the woods he wrought, and there, among</span>
<span class="i0">Some lab’ring seamen, heard his native tongue.</span>
<span class="i0">The sound, one moment, broke upon his pain</span>
<span class="i0">With joyful force; he long’d to hear again;</span>
<span class="i0">Again he heard; he seized an offer’d hand,</span>
<span class="i0">“And when beheld you last our native land?”</span>
<span class="i0">He cry’d, “and in what county? quickly say!”&mdash; <span class="linenum">380</span></span>
<span class="i0">The seamen answer’d, strangers all were they;</span>
<span class="i0">One only at his native port had been;</span>
<span class="i0">He, landing once, the quay and church had seen,</span>
<span class="i0">For that esteem’d; but nothing more he knew.</span>
<span class="i0">Still more to know, would Allen join the crew,</span>
<span class="i0">Sail where they sail’d; and, many a peril past,</span>
<span class="i0">They at his kinsman’s isle their anchor cast;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But him they found not, nor could one relate</span>
<span class="i0">Aught of his will, his wish, or his estate.</span>
<span class="i0">This grieved not Allen; then again he sail’d <span class="linenum">390</span></span>
<span class="i0">For England’s coast, again his fate prevail’d:</span>
<span class="i0">War raged, and he, an active man and strong,</span>
<span class="i0">Was soon impress’d, and served his country long.</span>
<span class="i0">By various shores he pass’d, on various seas,</span>
<span class="i0">Never so happy as when void of ease.&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">And then he told how, in a calm distress’d,</span>
<span class="i0">Day after day his soul was sick of rest;</span>
<span class="i0">When as a log upon the deep they stood,</span>
<span class="i0">Then roved his spirit to the inland wood;</span>
<span class="i0">Till, while awake, he dream’d, that on the seas <span class="linenum">400</span></span>
<span class="i0">Were his loved home, the hill, the stream, the trees.</span>
<span class="i0">He gazed, he pointed to the scenes:&mdash;“There stand</span>
<span class="i0">My wife, my children, ’tis my lovely land;</span>
<span class="i0">See! there my dwelling&mdash;oh! delicious scene</span>
<span class="i0">Of my best life&mdash;unhand me&mdash;are ye men?”</span>
<span class="i2">And thus the frenzy ruled him, till the wind</span>
<span class="i0">Brush’d the fond pictures from the stagnant mind.</span>
<span class="i2">He told of bloody fights, and how at length</span>
<span class="i0">The rage of battle gave his spirits strength.</span>
<span class="i0">’Twas in the Indian seas his limb he lost, <span class="linenum">410</span></span>
<span class="i0">And he was left half-dead upon the coast;</span>
<span class="i0">But living gain’d, ’mid rich aspiring men,</span>
<span class="i0">A fair subsistence by his ready pen.</span>
<span class="i0">“Thus,” he continued, “pass’d unvaried years,</span>
<span class="i0">Without events producing hopes or fears.”</span>
<span class="i0">Augmented pay procured him decent wealth,</span>
<span class="i0">But years advancing undermined his health;</span>
<span class="i0">Then oft-times in delightful dream he flew</span>
<span class="i0">To England’s shore, and scenes his childhood knew:</span>
<span class="i0">He saw his parents, saw his fav’rite maid, <span class="linenum">420</span></span>
<span class="i0">No feature wrinkled, not a charm decay’d;</span>
<span class="i0">And, thus excited, in his bosom rose</span>
<span class="i0">A wish so strong, it baffled his repose;</span>
<span class="i0">Anxious he felt on English earth to lie;</span>
<span class="i0">To view his native soil, and there to die.</span>
<span class="i2">He then described the gloom, the dread he found,</span>
<span class="i0">When first he landed on the chosen ground,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Where undefined was all he hoped and fear’d,</span>
<span class="i0">And how confused and troubled all appear’d;</span>
<span class="i0">His thoughts in past and present scenes employ’d, <span class="linenum">430</span></span>
<span class="i0">All views in future blighted and destroy’d:</span>
<span class="i0">His were a medley of bewild’ring themes,</span>
<span class="i0">Sad as realities, and wild as dreams.</span>
<span class="i2">Here his relation closes, but his mind</span>
<span class="i0">Flies back again, some resting-place to find;</span>
<span class="i0">Thus silent, musing through the day, he sees</span>
<span class="i0">His children sporting by those lofty trees,</span>
<span class="i0">Their mother singing in the shady scene,</span>
<span class="i0">Where the fresh springs burst o’er the lively green;&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">So strong his eager fancy, he affrights <span class="linenum">440</span></span>
<span class="i0">The faithful widow by its powerful flights;</span>
<span class="i0">For what disturbs him he aloud will tell,</span>
<span class="i0">And cry&mdash;“’Tis she, my wife! my Isabel!</span>
<span class="i0">Where are my children?”&mdash;Judith grieves to hear</span>
<span class="i0">How the soul works in sorrows so severe;</span>
<span class="i0">Assiduous all his wishes to attend,</span>
<span class="i0">Deprived of much, he yet may boast a friend;</span>
<span class="i0">Watch’d by her care, in sleep, his spirit takes</span>
<span class="i0">Its flight, and watchful finds her when he wakes.</span>
<span class="i2">’Tis now her office; her attention see! <span class="linenum">450</span></span>
<span class="i0">While her friend sleeps beneath that shading tree,</span>
<span class="i0">Careful she guards him from the glowing heat,</span>
<span class="i0">And pensive muses at her Allen’s feet.</span>
<span class="i2">And where is he? Ah! doubtless in those scenes</span>
<span class="i0">Of his best days, amid the vivid greens,</span>
<span class="i0">Fresh with unnumber’d rills, where ev’ry gale</span>
<span class="i0">Breathes the rich fragrance of the neighb’ring vale;</span>
<span class="i0">Smiles not his wife, and listens as there comes</span>
<span class="i0">The night-bird’s music from the thickening glooms?</span>
<span class="i0">And as he sits with all these treasures nigh, <span class="ws8">}</span><span class="linenum">460</span></span>
<span class="i0">Blaze not with fairy light the phosphor-fly, <span class="ws8">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">When like a sparkling gem it wheels illumined by? &emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">This is the joy that now so plainly speaks</span>
<span class="i0">In the warm transient flushing of his cheeks;</span>
<span class="i0">For he is list’ning to the fancied noise</span>
<span class="i0">Of his own children, eager in their joys:</span>
<span class="i0">All this he feels, a dream’s delusive bliss</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Gives the expression, and the glow like this.</span>
<span class="i0">And now his Judith lays her knitting by,</span>
<span class="i0">These strong emotions in her friend to spy; <span class="linenum">470</span></span>
<span class="i0">For she can fully of their nature deem&mdash;&mdash;<span class="ws11">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">But see! he breaks the long-protracted theme,<span class="ws9">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And wakes and cries&mdash;“My God! ’twas but a dream.”&emsp;}</span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Gwyn was a farmer, whom the farmers all,</span>
<span class="i0">Who dwelt around, the Gentleman would call;</span>
<span class="i0">Whether in pure humility or pride,</span>
<span class="i0">They only knew, and they would not decide.</span>
<span class="i2">Far diff’rent he from that dull plodding tribe,</span>
<span class="i0">Whom it was his amusement to describe;</span>
<span class="i0">Creatures no more enliven’d than a clod,</span>
<span class="i0">But treading still as their dull fathers trod;</span>
<span class="i0">Who lived in times when not a man had seen</span>
<span class="i0">Corn sown by drill, or thresh’d by a machine: <span class="linenum">10</span></span>
<span class="i0">He was of those whose skill assigns the prize</span>
<span class="i0">For creatures fed in pens, and stalls, and sties;</span>
<span class="i0">And who, in places where improvers meet,</span>
<span class="i0">To fill the land with fatness, had a seat;</span>
<span class="i0">Who in large mansions live like petty kings,</span>
<span class="i0">And speak of farms but as amusing things;</span>
<span class="i0">Who plans encourage, and who journals keep,</span>
<span class="i0">And talk with lords about a breed of sheep.</span>
<span class="i2">Two are the species in this genus known;</span>
<span class="i0">One, who is rich in his profession grown, <span class="linenum">20</span></span>
<span class="i0">Who yearly finds his ample stores increase,</span>
<span class="i0">From fortune’s favours and a favouring lease;</span>
<span class="i0">Who rides his hunter, who his house adorns;</span>
<span class="i0">Who drinks his wine, and his disbursements scorns,</span>
<span class="i0">Who freely lives, and loves to show he can&mdash;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
<span class="i0">This is the farmer, made the gentleman.</span>
<span class="i2">The second species from the world is sent,</span>
<span class="i0">Tired with its strife, or with his wealth content;</span>
<span class="i0">In books and men beyond the former read,</span>
<span class="i0">To farming solely by a passion led, <span class="linenum">30</span></span>
<span class="i0">Or by a fashion; curious in his land;</span>
<span class="i0">Now planning much, now changing what he plann’d;</span>
<span class="i0">Pleased by each trial, not by failures vex’d,</span>
<span class="i0">And ever certain to succeed the next;</span>
<span class="i0">Quick to resolve, and easy to persuade&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">This is the gentleman, a farmer made.</span>
<span class="i2">Gwyn was of these; he from the world withdrew</span>
<span class="i0">Early in life, his reasons known to few;</span>
<span class="i0">Some disappointment said, some pure good sense,</span>
<span class="i0">The love of land, the press of indolence; <span class="linenum">40</span></span>
<span class="i0">His fortune known, and coming to retire,</span>
<span class="i0">If not a farmer, men had call’d him ’squire.</span>
<span class="i2">Forty and five his years, no child or wife</span>
<span class="i0">Cross’d the still tenour of his chosen life;</span>
<span class="i0">Much land he purchased, planted far around,</span>
<span class="i0">And let some portions of superfluous ground</span>
<span class="i0">To farmers near him, not displeased to say,</span>
<span class="i0">“My tenants,” nor, “our worthy landlord,” they.</span>
<span class="i2">Fix’d in his farm, he soon display’d his skill</span>
<span class="i0">In small-boned lambs, the horse-hoe, and the drill; <span class="linenum">50</span></span>
<span class="i0">From these he rose to themes of nobler kind,</span>
<span class="i0">And show’d the riches of a fertile mind;</span>
<span class="i0">To all around their visits he repaid,</span>
<span class="i0">And thus his mansion and himself display’d.</span>
<span class="i0">His rooms were stately, rather fine than neat,</span>
<span class="i0">And guests politely call’d his house a seat;</span>
<span class="i0">At much expense was each apartment graced,</span>
<span class="i0">His taste was gorgeous, but it still was taste;</span>
<span class="i0">In full festoons the crimson curtains fell,</span>
<span class="i0">The sofas rose in bold elastic swell; <span class="linenum">60</span></span>
<span class="i0">Mirrors in gilded frames display’d the tints</span>
<span class="i0">Of glowing carpets and of colour’d prints;</span>
<span class="i0">The weary eye saw every object shine,</span>
<span class="i0">And all was costly, fanciful, and fine.</span>
<span class="i2">As with his friends he pass’d the social hours,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
<span class="i0">His generous spirit scorn’d to hide its powers;</span>
<span class="i0">Powers unexpected, for his eye and air</span>
<span class="i0">Gave no sure signs that eloquence was there;</span>
<span class="i0">Oft he began with sudden fire and force,</span>
<span class="i0">As loth to lose occasion for discourse; <span class="linenum">70</span></span>
<span class="i0">Some, ’tis observed, who feel a wish to speak,</span>
<span class="i0">Will a due place for introduction seek;</span>
<span class="i0">On to their purpose step by step they steal,</span>
<span class="i0">And all their way, by certain signals, feel;</span>
<span class="i0">Others plunge in at once, and never heed</span>
<span class="i0">Whose turn they take, whose purpose they impede;</span>
<span class="i0">Resolved to shine, they hasten to begin,</span>
<span class="i0">Of ending thoughtless&mdash;and of these was Gwyn.</span>
<span class="i0">And thus he spake:</span>
<span class="i14">&mdash;&mdash;“It grieves me to the soul</span>
<span class="i0">To see how man submits to man’s control; <span class="linenum">80</span></span>
<span class="i0">How overpower’d and shackled minds are led</span>
<span class="i0">In vulgar tracks, and to submission bred;</span>
<span class="i0">The coward never on himself relies,</span>
<span class="i0">But to an equal for assistance flies;</span>
<span class="i0">Man yields to custom as he bows to fate,</span>
<span class="i0">In all things ruled&mdash;mind, body, and estate;</span>
<span class="i0">In pain, in sickness, we for cure apply</span>
<span class="i0">To them we know not, and we know not why;</span>
<span class="i0">But that the creature has some jargon read,</span>
<span class="i0">And got some Scotchman’s system in his head; <span class="linenum">90</span></span>
<span class="i0">Some grave impostor, who will health insure,</span>
<span class="i0">Long as your patience or your wealth endure;</span>
<span class="i0">But mark them well, the pale and sickly crew,</span>
<span class="i0">They have not health, and can they give it you?</span>
<span class="i0">These solemn cheats their various methods choose;</span>
<span class="i0">A system fires them, as a bard his muse:</span>
<span class="i0">Hence wordy wars arise; the learn’d divide,</span>
<span class="i0">And groaning patients curse each erring guide.</span>
<span class="i2">“Next, our affairs are govern’d, buy or sell,</span>
<span class="i0">Upon the deed the law must fix its spell; <span class="linenum">100</span></span>
<span class="i0">Whether we hire or let, we must have still</span>
<span class="i0">The dubious aid of an attorney’s skill;</span>
<span class="i0">They take a part in every man’s affairs,</span>
<span class="i0">And in all business some concern is theirs;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Because mankind in ways prescribed are found,</span>
<span class="i0">Like flocks that follow on a beaten ground,</span>
<span class="i0">Each abject nature in the way proceeds,</span>
<span class="i0">That now to shearing, now to slaughter leads.</span>
<span class="i2">“Should you offend, though meaning no offence,</span>
<span class="i0">You have no safety in your innocence; <span class="linenum">110</span></span>
<span class="i0">The statute broken then is placed in view,</span>
<span class="i0">And men must pay for crimes they never knew.</span>
<span class="i0">Who would by law regain his plunder’d store,</span>
<span class="i0">Would pick up fallen merc’ry from the floor;</span>
<span class="i0">If he pursue it, here and there it slides;</span>
<span class="i0">He would collect it, but it more divides;</span>
<span class="i0">This part and this he stops, but still in vain,</span>
<span class="i0">It slips aside, and breaks in parts again;</span>
<span class="i0">Till, after time and pains, and care and cost,</span>
<span class="i0">He finds his labour and his object lost. <span class="linenum">120</span></span>
<span class="i2">“But most it grieves me, (friends alone are round,)</span>
<span class="i0">To see a man in priestly fetters bound;</span>
<span class="i0">Guides to the soul, these friends of Heaven contrive,</span>
<span class="i0">Long as man lives, to keep his fears alive;</span>
<span class="i0">Soon as an infant breathes, their rites begin;</span>
<span class="i0">Who knows not sinning, must be freed from sin;</span>
<span class="i0">Who needs no bond must yet engage in vows;</span>
<span class="i0">Who has no judgment, must a creed espouse:</span>
<span class="i0">Advanced in life, our boys are bound by rules, }</span>
<span class="i0">Are catechised in churches, cloisters, schools, &nbsp;}<span class="linenum">130</span></span>
<span class="i0">And train’d in thraldom to be fit for tools;<span class="ws4">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">The youth grown up, he now a partner needs,</span>
<span class="i0">And lo! a priest, as soon as he succeeds.</span>
<span class="i0">What man of sense can marriage-rites approve?</span>
<span class="i0">What man of spirit can be bound to love?</span>
<span class="i0">Forced to be kind! compell’d to be sincere!</span>
<span class="i0">Do chains and fetters make companions dear?</span>
<span class="i0">Pris’ners indeed we bind; but though the bond</span>
<span class="i0">May keep them safe, it does not make them fond:</span>
<span class="i0">The ring, the vow, the witness, licence, prayers, <span class="linenum">140</span></span>
<span class="i0">All parties known! made public all affairs!</span>
<span class="i0">Such forms men suffer, and from these they date</span>
<span class="i0">A deed of love begun with all they hate.</span>
<span class="i0">Absurd, that none the beaten road should shun,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But love to do what other dupes have done!</span>
<span class="i2">“Well, now your priest has made you one of twain,</span>
<span class="i0">Look you for rest? Alas! you look in vain.</span>
<span class="i0">If sick, he comes; you cannot die in peace,</span>
<span class="i0">Till he attends to witness your release;</span>
<span class="i0">To vex your soul, and urge you to confess <span class="linenum">150</span></span>
<span class="i0">The sins you feel, remember, or can guess;</span>
<span class="i0">Nay, when departed, to your grave he goes,</span>
<span class="i0">But there indeed he hurts not your repose.</span>
<span class="i2">“Such are our burthens; part we must sustain,</span>
<span class="i0">But need not link new grievance to the chain.</span>
<span class="i0">Yet men like idiots will their frames surround</span>
<span class="i0">With these vile shackles, nor confess they’re bound;</span>
<span class="i0">In all that most confines them they confide,</span>
<span class="i0">Their slavery boast, and make their bonds their pride;</span>
<span class="i0">E’en as the pressure galls them, they declare, <span class="linenum">160</span></span>
<span class="i0">(Good souls!) how happy and how free they are!</span>
<span class="i0">As madmen, pointing round their wretched cells,</span>
<span class="i0">Cry, ‘Lo! the palace where our honour dwells.’</span>
<span class="i2">“Such is our state: but I resolve to live</span>
<span class="i0">By rules my reason and my feelings give;</span>
<span class="i0">No legal guards shall keep enthrall’d my mind,</span>
<span class="i0">No slaves command me, and no teachers blind.</span>
<span class="i2">“Tempted by sins, let me their strength defy,</span>
<span class="i0">But have no second in a surplice by</span>
<span class="i0">No bottle-holder, with officious aid, <span class="linenum">170</span></span>
<span class="i0">To comfort conscience, weaken’d and afraid:</span>
<span class="i0">Then if I yield, my frailty is not known;</span>
<span class="i0">And, if I stand, the glory is my own.</span>
<span class="i2">“When Truth and Reason are our friends, we seem</span>
<span class="i0">Alive! awake!&mdash;the superstitious dream.</span>
<span class="i2">“Oh! then, fair Truth, for thee alone I seek,</span>
<span class="i0">Friend to the wise, supporter of the weak;</span>
<span class="i0">From thee we learn whate’er is right and just;</span>
<span class="i0">Forms to despise, professions to distrust;</span>
<span class="i0">Creeds to reject, pretensions to deride, <span class="linenum">180</span></span>
<span class="i0">And, following thee, to follow none beside.”</span>
<span class="i2">Such was the speech; it struck upon the ear</span>
<span class="i0">Like sudden thunder, none expect to hear.</span>
<span class="i0">He saw men’s wonder with a manly pride,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And gravely smiled at guest electrified;</span>
<span class="i0">“A farmer this!” they said, “Oh! let him seek</span>
<span class="i0">That place where he may for his country speak;</span>
<span class="i0">On some great question to harangue for hours,</span>
<span class="i0">While speakers hearing, envy nobler powers!”</span>
<span class="i2">Wisdom like this, as all things rich and rare, <span class="linenum">190</span></span>
<span class="i0">Must be acquired with pains, and kept with care;</span>
<span class="i0">In books he sought it, which his friends might view,</span>
<span class="i0">When their kind host the guarding curtain drew.</span>
<span class="i0">There were historic works for graver hours,</span>
<span class="i0">And lighter verse, to spur the languid powers;</span>
<span class="i0">There metaphysics, logic there had place;</span>
<span class="i0">But of devotion not a single trace&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Save what is taught in Gibbon’s florid page,</span>
<span class="i0">And other guides of this inquiring age;</span>
<span class="i0">There Hume appear’d, and, near, a splendid book <span class="linenum">200</span></span>
<span class="i0">Composed by Gay’s good Lord of Bolingbroke:</span>
<span class="i0">With these were mix’d the light, the free, the vain,</span>
<span class="i0">And from a corner peep’d the sage Tom Paine:</span>
<span class="i0">Here four neat volumes ‘Chesterfield’ were named,</span>
<span class="i0">For manners much and easy morals famed;</span>
<span class="i0">With chaste Memoirs of Females, to be read</span>
<span class="i0">When deeper studies had confused the head.</span>
<span class="i2">Such his resources, treasures where he sought</span>
<span class="i0">For daily knowledge till his mind was fraught:</span>
<span class="i0">Then, when his friends were present, for their use <span class="linenum">210</span></span>
<span class="i0">He would the riches he had stored produce;</span>
<span class="i0">He found his lamp burn clearer, when each day</span>
<span class="i0">He drew for all he purposed to display.</span>
<span class="i0">For these occasions, forth his knowledge sprung,</span>
<span class="i0">As mustard quickens on a bed of dung;</span>
<span class="i0">All was prepared, and guests allow’d the praise,</span>
<span class="i0">For what they saw he could so quickly raise.</span>
<span class="i2">Such this new friend; and, when the year came round,</span>
<span class="i0">The same impressive, reasoning sage was found:</span>
<span class="i0">Then, too, was seen the pleasant mansion graced <span class="linenum">220</span></span>
<span class="i0">With a fair damsel&mdash;his no vulgar taste:</span>
<span class="i0">The neat Rebecca&mdash;sly, observant, still;</span>
<span class="i0">Watching his eye, and waiting on his will;</span>
<span class="i0">Simple yet smart her dress, her manners meek,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Her smiles spoke for her, she would seldom speak;</span>
<span class="i0">But watch’d each look, each meaning to detect,</span>
<span class="i0">And (pleas’d with notice) felt for all neglect.</span>
<span class="i2">With her lived Gwyn a sweet harmonious life,</span>
<span class="i0">Who, forms excepted, was a charming wife.</span>
<span class="i0">The wives indeed, so made by vulgar law, <span class="linenum">230</span></span>
<span class="i0">Affected scorn, and censured what they saw;</span>
<span class="i0">And what they saw not, fancied; said ’twas sin,</span>
<span class="i0">And took no notice of the wife of Gwyn.</span>
<span class="i0">But he despised their rudeness, and would prove</span>
<span class="i0">Theirs was compulsion and distrust, not love;</span>
<span class="i0">“Fools as they were! could they conceive that rings</span>
<span class="i0">And parsons’ blessings were substantial things?”</span>
<span class="i0">They answer’d “Yes;” while he contemptuous spoke</span>
<span class="i0">Of the low notions held by simple folk;</span>
<span class="i0">Yet, strange that anger in a man so wise <span class="ws5">}</span><span class="linenum">240</span></span>
<span class="i0">Should from the notions of these fools arise;&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">Can they so vex us, whom we so despise?<span class="ws4">}</span></span>
<span class="i2">Brave as he was, our hero felt a dread</span>
<span class="i0">Lest those who saw him kind should think him led;</span>
<span class="i0">If to his bosom fear a visit paid,</span>
<span class="i0">It was, lest he should be supposed afraid.</span>
<span class="i0">Hence sprang his orders; not that he desired</span>
<span class="i0">The things when done: obedience he required;</span>
<span class="i0">And thus, to prove his absolute command,</span>
<span class="i0">Ruled every heart, and moved each subject hand; <span class="linenum">250</span></span>
<span class="i0">Assent he ask’d for every word and whim,</span>
<span class="i0">To prove that <i>he alone was king of him</i>.</span>
<span class="i2">The still Rebecca, who her station knew,</span>
<span class="i0">With ease resign’d the honours not her due;</span>
<span class="i0">Well pleased, she saw that men her board would grace,</span>
<span class="i0">And wish’d not there to see a female face;</span>
<span class="i0">When by her lover she his spouse was styled,</span>
<span class="i0">Polite she thought it, and demurely smiled;</span>
<span class="i0">But when he wanted wives and maidens round</span>
<span class="i0">So to regard her, she grew grave, and frown’d; <span class="linenum">260</span></span>
<span class="i0">And sometimes whisper’d&mdash;“Why should you respect</span>
<span class="i0">These people’s notions, yet their forms reject?”</span>
<span class="i2">Gwyn, though from marriage bond and fetter free,</span>
<span class="i0">Still felt abridgment in his liberty;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Something of hesitation he betray’d,</span>
<span class="i0">And in her presence thought of what he said.</span>
<span class="i0">Thus fair Rebecca, though she walk’d astray,</span>
<span class="i0">His creed rejecting, judged it right to pray;</span>
<span class="i0">To be at church, to sit with serious looks,</span>
<span class="i0">To read her Bible and her Sunday-books. <span class="linenum">270</span></span>
<span class="i0">She hated all those new and daring themes,</span>
<span class="i0">And call’d his free conjectures “devil’s dreams;”</span>
<span class="i0">She honour’d still the priesthood in her fall,</span>
<span class="i0">And claim’d respect and reverence for them all;</span>
<span class="i0">Call’d them “of sin’s destructive power the foes,</span>
<span class="i0">And not such blockheads as he might suppose.”</span>
<span class="i0">Gwyn to his friends would smile, and sometimes say,</span>
<span class="i0">“’Tis a kind fool, why vex her in her way?”</span>
<span class="i0">Her way she took, and still had more in view,</span>
<span class="i0">For she contrived that he should take it too. <span class="linenum">280</span></span>
<span class="i0">The daring freedom of his soul, ’twas plain,</span>
<span class="i0">In part was lost in a divided reign:</span>
<span class="i0">A king and queen, who yet in prudence sway’d</span>
<span class="i0">Their peaceful state, and were in turn obey’d.</span>
<span class="i2">Yet such our fate that, when we plan the best,</span>
<span class="i0">Something arises to disturb our rest:</span>
<span class="i0">For, though in spirits high, in body strong,</span>
<span class="i0">Gwyn something felt&mdash;he knew not what&mdash;was wrong;</span>
<span class="i0">He wish’d to know, for he believed the thing,</span>
<span class="i0">If unremoved, would other evil bring: <span class="linenum">290</span></span>
<span class="i0">She must perceive, of late he could not eat,</span>
<span class="i0">And when he walk’d, he trembled on his feet;</span>
<span class="i0">He had forebodings, and he seem’d as one</span>
<span class="i0">Stopp’d on the road, or threatened by a dun;</span>
<span class="i0">He could not live, and yet, should he apply</span>
<span class="i0">To those physicians&mdash;he must sooner die.”</span>
<span class="i2">The mild Rebecca heard with some disdain,</span>
<span class="i0">And some distress, her friend and lord complain:</span>
<span class="i0">His death she fear’d not, but had painful doubt</span>
<span class="i0">What his distemper’d nerves might bring about; <span class="linenum">300</span></span>
<span class="i0">With power like hers she dreaded an ally,</span>
<span class="i0">And yet there was a person in her eye;&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">She thought, debated, fix’d&mdash;“Alas!” she said,</span>
<span class="i0">A case like yours must be no more delay’d.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
<span class="i0">You hate these doctors; well! but were a friend</span>
<span class="i0">And doctor one, your fears would have an end.</span>
<span class="i0">My cousin Mollet&mdash;Scotland holds him now&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Is above all men skilful, all allow:</span>
<span class="i0">Of late a doctor, and within a while</span>
<span class="i0">He means to settle in this favour’d isle; <span class="linenum">310</span></span>
<span class="i0">Should he attend you, with his skill profound,</span>
<span class="i0">You must be safe, and shortly would be sound.”</span>
<span class="i2">When men in health against physicians rail,</span>
<span class="i0">They should consider that their nerves may fail;</span>
<span class="i0">Who calls a lawyer rogue, may find, too late,</span>
<span class="i0">On one of these depends his whole estate;</span>
<span class="i0">Nay, when the world can nothing more produce,</span>
<span class="i0">The priest, th’ insulted priest, may have his use.</span>
<span class="i0">Ease, health, and comfort, lift a man so high,</span>
<span class="i0">These powers are dwarfs that he can scarcely spy; <span class="linenum">320</span></span>
<span class="i0">Pain, sickness, languor, keep a man so low,</span>
<span class="i0">That these neglected dwarfs to giants grow.</span>
<span class="i0">Happy is he who through the medium sees</span>
<span class="i0">Of clear good sense&mdash;but Gwyn was not of these.</span>
<span class="i2">He heard and he rejoiced: “Ah! let him come,</span>
<span class="i0">And, till he fixes, make my house his home.”</span>
<span class="i0">Home came the doctor&mdash;he was much admired;</span>
<span class="i0">He told the patient what his case required;</span>
<span class="i0">His hours for sleep, his time to eat and drink;</span>
<span class="i0">When he should ride, read, rest, compose, or think. <span class="linenum">330</span></span>
<span class="i0">Thus join’d peculiar skill and art profound,</span>
<span class="i0">To make the fancy-sick no more than fancy-sound.</span>
<span class="i2">With such attention, who could long be ill?</span>
<span class="i0">Returning health proclaim’d the doctor’s skill.</span>
<span class="i0">Presents and praises from a grateful heart</span>
<span class="i0">Were freely offer’d on the patient’s part;</span>
<span class="i0">In high repute the doctor seem’d to stand,</span>
<span class="i0">But still had got no footing in the land;</span>
<span class="i0">And, as he saw the seat was rich and fair,</span>
<span class="i0">He felt disposed to fix his station there. <span class="linenum">340</span></span>
<span class="i0">To gain his purpose, he perform’d the part</span>
<span class="i0">Of a good actor, and prepared to start&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Not like a traveller in a day serene,</span>
<span class="i0">When the sun shone and when the roads were clean;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Not like the pilgrim, when the morning gray,</span>
<span class="i0">The ruddy eve succeeding, sends his way;</span>
<span class="i0">But in a season when the sharp east wind</span>
<span class="i0">Had all its influence on a nervous mind.</span>
<span class="i0">When past the parlour’s front it fiercely blew,<span class="ws1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And Gwyn sat pitying every bird that flew, <span class="ws3">}</span><span class="linenum">350</span></span>
<span class="i0">This strange physician said&mdash;“Adieu! adieu!&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">Farewell!&mdash;Heaven bless you!&mdash;if you should&mdash;but no,</span>
<span class="i0">You need not fear&mdash;farewell! ’tis time to go.”</span>
<span class="i2">The doctor spoke; and as the patient heard,</span>
<span class="i0">His old disorders (dreadful train!) appear’d;</span>
<span class="i0">He felt the tingling tremor, and the stress</span>
<span class="i0">Upon his nerves that he could not express;</span>
<span class="i0">Should his good friend forsake him, he perhaps</span>
<span class="i0">Might meet his death, and surely a relapse.”</span>
<span class="i2">So, as the doctor seem’d intent to part, <span class="linenum">360</span></span>
<span class="i0">He cried in terror&mdash;“Oh! be where thou art:</span>
<span class="i0">Come, thou art young, and unengaged; oh! come,</span>
<span class="i0">Make me thy friend, give comfort to mine home;</span>
<span class="i0">I have now symptoms that require thine aid,</span>
<span class="i0">Do, doctor, stay”&mdash;th’ obliging doctor stay’d.</span>
<span class="i2">Thus Gwyn was happy; he had now a friend,</span>
<span class="i0">And a meek spouse on whom he could depend.</span>
<span class="i0">But now, possess’d of male and female guide,</span>
<span class="i0">Divided power he thus must subdivide:</span>
<span class="i0">In earlier days he rode, or sat at ease <span class="linenum">370</span></span>
<span class="i0">Reclined, and having but himself to please;</span>
<span class="i0">Now, if he would a fav’rite nag bestride,</span>
<span class="i0">He sought permission&mdash;“Doctor, may I ride?”&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">(Rebecca’s eye her sovereign pleasure told,)&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“I think you may; but, guarded from the cold,</span>
<span class="i0">Ride forty minutes.”&mdash;Free and happy soul!</span>
<span class="i0">He scorn’d submission, and a man’s control;</span>
<span class="i0">But where such friends in every care unite</span>
<span class="i0">All for his good, obedience is delight.</span>
<span class="i2">Now Gwyn, a sultan, bade affairs adieu, <span class="linenum">380</span></span>
<span class="i0">Led and assisted by the faithful two;</span>
<span class="i0">The favourite fair, Rebecca, near him sat,</span>
<span class="i0">And whisper’d whom to love, assist, or hate;</span>
<span class="i0">While the chief vizier eased his lord of cares,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And bore himself the burden of affairs.</span>
<span class="i0">No dangers could from such alliance flow,</span>
<span class="i0">But from that law that changes all below.</span>
<span class="i2">When wint’ry winds with leaves bestrew’d the ground,</span>
<span class="i0">And men were coughing all the village round;</span>
<span class="i0">When public papers of invasion told, <span class="linenum">390</span></span>
<span class="i0">Diseases, famines, perils new and old;</span>
<span class="i0">When philosophic writers fail’d to clear</span>
<span class="i0">The mind of gloom, and lighter works to cheer;</span>
<span class="i0">Then came fresh terrors on our hero’s mind&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Fears unforeseen, and feelings undefined.</span>
<span class="i2">“In outward ills,” he cried, “I rest assured</span>
<span class="i0">Of my friend’s aid; they will in time be cured:</span>
<span class="i0">But can his art subdue, resist, control</span>
<span class="i0">These inward griefs and troubles of the soul?</span>
<span class="i0">Oh! my Rebecca! my disorder’d mind <span class="linenum">400</span></span>
<span class="i0">No help in study, none in thought can find;</span>
<span class="i0">What must I do, Rebecca?” She proposed</span>
<span class="i0">The parish-guide; but what could be disclosed</span>
<span class="i0">To a proud priest?&mdash;“No! him have I defied,</span>
<span class="i0">Insulted, slighted&mdash;shall he be my guide?</span>
<span class="i0">But one there is, and if report be just,</span>
<span class="i0">A wise good man, whom I may safely trust;</span>
<span class="i0">Who goes from house to house, from ear to ear,<span class="ws4">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">To make his truths, his Gospel truths, appear;<span class="ws6">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">True if indeed they be, ’tis time that I should hear.&emsp;}<span class="linenum">410</span></span>
<span class="i0">Send for that man; and if report be just,</span>
<span class="i0">I, like Cornelius, will the teacher trust;</span>
<span class="i0">But, if deceiver, I the vile deceit</span>
<span class="i0">Shall soon discover, and discharge the cheat.”</span>
<span class="i2">To Doctor Mollet was the grief confess’d,</span>
<span class="i0">While Gwyn the freedom of his mind express’d;</span>
<span class="i0">Yet own’d it was to ills and errors prone,</span>
<span class="i0">And he for guilt and frailty must atone.</span>
<span class="i0">“My books, perhaps,” the wav’ring mortal cried,</span>
<span class="i0">“Like men deceive&mdash;I would be satisfied; <span class="linenum">420</span></span>
<span class="i0">And to my soul the pious man may bring</span>
<span class="i0">Comfort and light&mdash;do let me try the thing.”</span>
<span class="i2">The cousins met; what pass’d with Gwyn was told;</span>
<span class="i0">“Alas!” the doctor said; “how hard to hold</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
<span class="i0">These easy minds, where all impressions made</span>
<span class="i0">At first sink deeply, and then quickly fade;</span>
<span class="i0">For while so strong these new-born fancies reign,</span>
<span class="i0">We must divert them, to oppose is vain.</span>
<span class="i0">You see him valiant now, he scorns to heed</span>
<span class="i0">The bigot’s threat’nings or the zealot’s creed; <span class="linenum">430</span></span>
<span class="i0">Shook by a dream, he next for truth receives</span>
<span class="i0">What frenzy teaches, and what fear believes;</span>
<span class="i0">And this will place him in the power of one</span>
<span class="i0">Whom we must seek, because we cannot shun.”</span>
<span class="i2">Wisp had been ostler at a busy inn,</span>
<span class="i0">Where he beheld and grew in dread of sin;</span>
<span class="i0">Then to a Baptists’ meeting found his way,</span>
<span class="i0">Became a convert, and was taught to pray;</span>
<span class="i0">Then preach’d; and, being earnest and sincere,</span>
<span class="i0">Brought other sinners to religious fear. <span class="linenum">440</span></span>
<span class="i0">Together grew his influence and his fame,</span>
<span class="i0">Till our dejected hero heard his name;</span>
<span class="i0">His little failings were a grain of pride,</span>
<span class="i0">Raised by the numbers he presumed to guide:</span>
<span class="i0">A love of presents, and of lofty praise</span>
<span class="i0">For his meek spirit and his humble ways;</span>
<span class="i0">But though this spirit would on flattery feed,</span>
<span class="i0">No praise could blind him and no arts mislead.</span>
<span class="i0">To him the doctor made the wishes known</span>
<span class="i0">Of his good patron, but concealed his own; <span class="linenum">450</span></span>
<span class="i0">He of all teachers had distrust and doubt,</span>
<span class="i0">And was reserved in what he came about;</span>
<span class="i0">Though on a plain and simple message sent,</span>
<span class="i0">He had a secret and a bold intent.</span>
<span class="i0">Their minds at first were deeply veil’d; disguise</span>
<span class="i0">Form’d the slow speech, and op’d the eager eyes;</span>
<span class="i0">Till by degrees sufficient light was thrown</span>
<span class="i0">On every view, and all the business shown.</span>
<span class="i0">Wisp, as a skilful guide who led the blind, <span class="ws10">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Had powers to rule and awe the vapourish mind, <span class="ws5">}</span><span class="linenum">460</span></span>
<span class="i0">But not the changeful will, the wavering fear to bind;&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">And, should his conscience give him leave to dwell</span>
<span class="i0">With Gwyn, and every rival power expel,</span>
<span class="i0">(A dubious point,) yet he, with every care,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Might soon the lot of the rejected share,</span>
<span class="i0">And other Wisps be found like him to reign,</span>
<span class="i0">And then be thrown upon the world again.</span>
<span class="i0">He thought it prudent, then, and felt it just,</span>
<span class="i0">The present guides of his new friend to trust;</span>
<span class="i0">True, he conceived, to touch the harder heart <span class="linenum">470</span></span>
<span class="i0">Of the cool doctor, was beyond his art;</span>
<span class="i0">But mild Rebecca he could surely sway,</span>
<span class="i0">While Gwyn would follow where she led the way:</span>
<span class="i0">So, to do good, (and why a duty shun,</span>
<span class="i0">Because rewarded for the good when done?)</span>
<span class="i0">He with his friends would join in all they plann’d,</span>
<span class="i0">Save when his faith or feelings should withstand;</span>
<span class="i0">There he must rest, sole judge of his affairs,</span>
<span class="i0">While they might rule exclusively in theirs.</span>
<span class="i2">When Gwyn his message to the teacher sent, <span class="linenum">480</span></span>
<span class="i0">He fear’d his friends would show their discontent;</span>
<span class="i0">And prudent seem’d it to th’ attendant pair,</span>
<span class="i0">Not all at once to show an aspect fair.</span>
<span class="i0">On Wisp they seem’d to look with jealous eye,</span>
<span class="i0">And fair Rebecca was demure and shy;</span>
<span class="i0">But by degrees the teacher’s worth they knew,</span>
<span class="i0">And were so kind, they seem’d converted too.</span>
<span class="i2">Wisp took occasion to the nymph to say,</span>
<span class="i0">“You must be married: will you name the day?”</span>
<span class="i0">She smiled,&mdash;“’Tis well; but, should he not comply, <span class="linenum">490</span></span>
<span class="i0">Is it quite safe th’ experiment to try?”&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“My child,” the teacher said, “who feels remorse,</span>
<span class="i0">(And feels not he?) must wish relief of course;</span>
<span class="i0">And can he find it, while he fears the crime?&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">You must be married; will you name the time?”</span>
<span class="i2">Glad was the patron as a man could be,<span class="ws16">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Yet marvell’d too, to find his guides agree;<span class="ws15">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">“But what the cause?” he cried; “’tis genuine love for me.”&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i2">Each found his part, and let one act describe</span>
<span class="i0">The powers and honours of th’ accordant tribe:&mdash; <span class="linenum">500</span></span>
<span class="i0">A man for favour to the mansion speeds,</span>
<span class="i0">And cons his threefold task as he proceeds;</span>
<span class="i0">To teacher Wisp he bows with humble air,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And begs his interest for a barn’s repair;</span>
<span class="i0">Then for the doctor he inquires, who loves</span>
<span class="i0">To hear applause for what his skill improves,</span>
<span class="i0">And gives, for praise, assent,&mdash;and to the fair</span>
<span class="i0">He brings of pullets a delicious pair;</span>
<span class="i0">Thus sees a peasant, with discernment nice,</span>
<span class="i0">A love of power, conceit, and avarice. <span class="linenum">510</span></span>
<span class="i2">Lo! now the change complete: the convert Gwyn</span>
<span class="i0">Has sold his books, and has renounced his sin;</span>
<span class="i0">Mollet his body orders, Wisp his soul,</span>
<span class="i0">And o’er his purse the lady takes control;</span>
<span class="i0">No friends beside he needs, and none attend&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Soul, body, and estate, has each a friend;</span>
<span class="i0">And fair Rebecca leads a virtuous life&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">She rules a mistress, and she reigns a wife.</span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Love will expire; the gay, the happy dream</span>
<span class="i0">Will turn to scorn, indiff’rence, or esteem.</span>
<span class="i0">Some favour’d pairs, in this exchange, are bless’d,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor sigh for raptures in a state of rest;</span>
<span class="i0">Others, ill match’d, with minds unpair’d, repent</span>
<span class="i0">At once the deed, and know no more content;</span>
<span class="i0">From joy to anguish they, in haste, decline,</span>
<span class="i0">And with their fondness, their esteem resign.</span>
<span class="i0">More luckless still their fate, who are the prey</span>
<span class="i0">Of long-protracted hope and dull delay; <span class="linenum">10</span></span>
<span class="i0">’Mid plans of bliss the heavy hours pass on,</span>
<span class="i0">Till love is wither’d, and till joy is gone.</span>
<span class="i2">This gentle flame two youthful hearts possess’d,</span>
<span class="i0">The sweet disturber of unenvied rest:</span>
<span class="i0">The prudent Dinah was the maid beloved,</span>
<span class="i0">And the kind Rupert was the swain approved.</span>
<span class="i0">A wealthy aunt her gentle niece sustain’d,</span>
<span class="i0">He, with a father, at his desk remain’d;</span>
<span class="i0">The youthful couple, to their vows sincere,<span class="ws12">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Thus loved expectant; year succeeding year,<span class="ws11">}</span><span class="linenum">20</span></span>
<span class="i0">With pleasant views and hopes, but not a prospect near.&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">Rupert some comfort in his station saw,</span>
<span class="i0">But the poor virgin lived in dread and awe;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Upon her anxious looks the widow smiled,</span>
<span class="i0">And bade her wait, “for she was yet a child.”</span>
<span class="i0">She for her neighbour had a due respect,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor would his son encourage or reject;</span>
<span class="i0">And thus the pair, with expectations vain,</span>
<span class="i0">Beheld the seasons change and change again.</span>
<span class="i0">Meantime the nymph her tender tales perused, <span class="linenum">30</span></span>
<span class="i0">Where cruel aunts impatient girls refused;</span>
<span class="i0">While hers, though teasing, boasted to be kind,</span>
<span class="i0">And she, resenting, to be all resign’d.</span>
<span class="i2">The dame was sick, and, when the youth applied</span>
<span class="i0">For her consent, she groan’d, and cough’d, and cried;</span>
<span class="i0">Talk’d of departing, and again her breath</span>
<span class="i0">Drew hard, and cough’d, and talk’d again of death:</span>
<span class="i0">“Here you may live, my Dinah! here the boy</span>
<span class="i0">And you together my estate enjoy.”</span>
<span class="i0">Thus to the lovers was her mind express’d, <span class="linenum">40</span></span>
<span class="i0">Till they forbore to urge the fond request.</span>
<span class="i2">Servant, and nurse, and comforter, and friend,</span>
<span class="i0">Dinah had still some duty to attend;</span>
<span class="i0">But yet their walk, when Rupert’s evening call</span>
<span class="i0">Obtain’d an hour, made sweet amends for all;</span>
<span class="i0">So long they now each other’s thoughts had known,</span>
<span class="i0">That nothing seem’d exclusively their own;</span>
<span class="i0">But with the common wish, the mutual fear,</span>
<span class="i0">They now had travell’d to their thirtieth year.</span>
<span class="i2">At length a prospect open’d&mdash;but, alas!</span>
<span class="i0">Long time must yet before the union pass; <span class="linenum">50</span></span>
<span class="i0">Rupert was call’d in other clime, t’increase</span>
<span class="i0">Another’s wealth, and toil for future peace;</span>
<span class="i0">Loth were the lovers; but the aunt declared</span>
<span class="i0">’Twas fortune’s call, and they must be prepared:</span>
<span class="i0">“You now are young, and for this brief delay,</span>
<span class="i0">And Dinah’s care, what I bequeath will pay;</span>
<span class="i0">All will be yours; nay, love, suppress that sigh;</span>
<span class="i0">The kind must suffer, and the best must die.”</span>
<span class="i0">Then came the cough, and strong the signs it gave</span>
<span class="i0">Of holding long contention with the grave. <span class="linenum">60</span></span>
<span class="i2">The lovers parted with a gloomy view,</span>
<span class="i0">And little comfort but that both were true;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
<span class="i0">He for uncertain duties doom’d to steer,</span>
<span class="i0">While hers remained too certain and severe.</span>
<span class="i2">Letters arrived, and Rupert fairly told</span>
<span class="i0">“His cares were many, and his hopes were cold;</span>
<span class="i0">The view more clouded, that was never fair,</span>
<span class="i0">And love alone preserved him from despair.”</span>
<span class="i0">In other letters brighter hopes he drew, <span class="linenum">70</span></span>
<span class="i0">“His friends were kind, and he believed them true.”</span>
<span class="i2">When the sage widow Dinah’s grief descried,</span>
<span class="i0">She wonder’d much why one so happy sigh’d;</span>
<span class="i0">Then bade her see how her poor aunt sustain’d</span>
<span class="i0">The ills of life, nor murmur’d nor complain’d.</span>
<span class="i0">To vary pleasures, from the lady’s chest</span>
<span class="i0">Were drawn the pearly string and tabby vest;</span>
<span class="i0">Beads, jewels, laces, all their value shown,</span>
<span class="i0">With the kind notice&mdash;“They will be your own.”</span>
<span class="i2">This hope, these comforts cherish’d day by day, <span class="linenum">80</span></span>
<span class="i0">To Dinah’s bosom made a gradual way;</span>
<span class="i0">Till love of treasure had as large a part</span>
<span class="i0">As love of Rupert in the virgin’s heart.</span>
<span class="i0">Whether it be that tender passions fail</span>
<span class="i0">From their own nature, while the strong prevail;</span>
<span class="i0">Or whether av’rice, like the poison-tree<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>,</span>
<span class="i0">Kills all beside it, and alone will be:</span>
<span class="i0">Whatever cause prevail’d, the pleasure grew</span>
<span class="i0">In Dinah’s soul&mdash;she loved the hoards to view;</span>
<span class="i0">With lively joy those comforts she survey’d, <span class="linenum">90</span></span>
<span class="i0">And love grew languid in the careful maid.</span>
<span class="i2">Now the grave niece partook the widow’s cares;</span>
<span class="i0">Look’d to the great and ruled the small affairs;</span>
<span class="i0">Saw clean’d the plate, arranged the china show,</span>
<span class="i0">And felt her passion for a shilling grow.</span>
<span class="i0">Th’ indulgent aunt increased the maid’s delight,</span>
<span class="i0">By placing tokens of her wealth in sight;</span>
<span class="i0">She loved the value of her bonds to tell,</span>
<span class="i0">And spake of stocks, and how they rose and fell.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
<span class="i2">This passion grew, and gain’d at length such sway, <span class="linenum">100</span></span>
<span class="i0">That other passions shrank to make it way;</span>
<span class="i0">Romantic notions now the heart forsook,</span>
<span class="i0">She read but seldom, and she changed her book;</span>
<span class="i0">And for the verses she was wont to send,</span>
<span class="i0">Short was her prose, and she was Rupert’s friend.</span>
<span class="i0">Seldom she wrote, and then the widow’s cough,</span>
<span class="i0">And constant call, excused her breaking off;</span>
<span class="i0">Who now, oppress’d, no longer took the air,</span>
<span class="i0">But sate and dozed upon an easy chair.</span>
<span class="i0">The cautious doctor saw the case was clear, <span class="linenum">110</span></span>
<span class="i0">But judged it best to have companions near;</span>
<span class="i0">They came, they reason’d, they prescribed&mdash;at last,</span>
<span class="i0">Like honest men, they said their hopes were past;</span>
<span class="i0">Then came a priest&mdash;’tis comfort to reflect,</span>
<span class="i0">When all is over, there was no neglect;</span>
<span class="i0">And all was over&mdash;by her husband’s bones,</span>
<span class="i0">The widow rests beneath the sculptured stones,</span>
<span class="i0">That yet record their fondness and their fame,</span>
<span class="i0">While all they left the virgin’s care became:</span>
<span class="i0">Stock, bonds, and buildings;&mdash;it disturb’d her rest, <span class="linenum">120</span></span>
<span class="i0">To think what load of troubles she possess’d.</span>
<span class="i0">Yet, if a trouble, she resolved to take</span>
<span class="i0">Th’ important duty, for the donor’s sake;</span>
<span class="i0">She too was heiress to the widow’s taste,</span>
<span class="i0">Her love of hoarding, and her dread of waste.</span>
<span class="i2">Sometimes the past would on her mind intrude,</span>
<span class="i0">And then a conflict full of care ensued;</span>
<span class="i0">The thoughts of Rupert on her mind would press,</span>
<span class="i0">His worth she knew, but doubted his success;</span>
<span class="i0">Of old she saw him heedless; what the boy <span class="linenum">130</span></span>
<span class="i0">Forbore to save, the man would not enjoy;</span>
<span class="i0">Oft had he lost the chance that care would seize,</span>
<span class="i0">Willing to live, but more to live at ease;</span>
<span class="i0">Yet could she not a broken vow defend,</span>
<span class="i0">And Heav’n, perhaps, might yet enrich her friend.</span>
<span class="i2">Month after month was pass’d, and all were spent</span>
<span class="i0">In quiet comfort and in rich content:</span>
<span class="i0">Miseries there were, and woes the world around,</span>
<span class="i0">But these had not her pleasant dwelling found;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
<span class="i0">She knew that mothers grieved, and widows wept, <span class="linenum">140</span></span>
<span class="i0">And she was sorry, said her prayers, and slept.</span>
<span class="i0">Thus pass’d the seasons, and to Dinah’s board</span>
<span class="i0">Gave what the seasons to the rich afford;</span>
<span class="i0">For she indulged, nor was her heart so small,</span>
<span class="i0">That one strong passion should engross it all.</span>
<span class="i2">A love of splendour now with av’rice strove,</span>
<span class="i0">And oft appear’d to be the stronger love;</span>
<span class="i0">A secret pleasure fill’d the widow’s breast,</span>
<span class="i0">When she reflected on the hoards possess’d;</span>
<span class="i0">But livelier joy inspired th’ ambitious maid, <span class="linenum">150</span></span>
<span class="i0">When she the purchase of those hoards display’d.</span>
<span class="i0">In small but splendid room she loved to see</span>
<span class="i0">That all was placed in view and harmony;</span>
<span class="i0">There, as with eager glance she look’d around,</span>
<span class="i0">She much delight in every object found;</span>
<span class="i0">While books devout were near her&mdash;to destroy,</span>
<span class="i0">Should it arise, an overflow of joy.</span>
<span class="i2">Within that fair apartment, guests might see</span>
<span class="i0">The comforts cull’d for wealth by vanity.</span>
<span class="i0">Around the room an Indian paper blazed, <span class="linenum">160</span></span>
<span class="i0">With lively tint and figures boldly raised;</span>
<span class="i0">Silky and soft upon the floor below,</span>
<span class="i0">Th’ elastic carpet rose with crimson glow;</span>
<span class="i0">All things around implied both cost and care;</span>
<span class="i0">What met the eye was elegant or rare.</span>
<span class="i0">Some curious trifles round the room were laid,</span>
<span class="i0">By hope presented to the wealthy maid:</span>
<span class="i0">Within a costly case of varnish’d wood,</span>
<span class="i0">In level rows, her polish’d volumes stood;</span>
<span class="i0">Shown as a favour to a chosen few, <span class="linenum">170</span></span>
<span class="i0">To prove what beauty for a book could do;</span>
<span class="i0">A silver urn with curious work was fraught;</span>
<span class="i0">A silver lamp from Grecian pattern wrought;</span>
<span class="i0">Above her head, all gorgeous to behold,</span>
<span class="i0">A time-piece stood on feet of burnish’d gold;</span>
<span class="i0">A stag’s-head crest adorn’d the pictured case,</span>
<span class="i0">Through the pure crystal shone th’ enamell’d face;</span>
<span class="i0">And, while on brilliants moved the hands of steel,</span>
<span class="i0">It click’d from pray’r to pray’r, from meal to meal.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
<span class="i2">Here as the lady sate, a friendly pair <span class="linenum">180</span></span>
<span class="i0">Stept in t’ admire the view, and took their chair.</span>
<span class="i0">They then related how the young and gay</span>
<span class="i0">Were thoughtless wandering in the broad highway;</span>
<span class="i0">How tender damsels sail’d in tilted boats,</span>
<span class="i0">And laugh’d with wicked men in scarlet coats;</span>
<span class="i0">And how we live in such degen’rate times</span>
<span class="i0">That men conceal their wants, and show their crimes;</span>
<span class="i0">While vicious deeds are screen’d by fashion’s name,</span>
<span class="i0">And what was once our pride is now our shame.</span>
<span class="i2">Dinah was musing, as her friends discoursed, <span class="linenum">190</span></span>
<span class="i0">When these last words a sudden entrance forced</span>
<span class="i0">Upon her mind, and what was once her pride</span>
<span class="i0">And now her shame, some painful views supplied;</span>
<span class="i0">Thoughts of the past within her bosom press’d,</span>
<span class="i0">And there a change was felt, and was confess’d.</span>
<span class="i0">While thus the virgin strove with secret pain,</span>
<span class="i0">Her mind was wandering o’er the troubled main;</span>
<span class="i0">Still she was silent, nothing seem’d to see,</span>
<span class="i0">But sate and sigh’d in pensive reverie.</span>
<span class="i2">The friends prepared new subjects to begin, <span class="linenum">200</span></span>
<span class="i0">When tall Susannah, maiden starch, stalk’d in;</span>
<span class="i0">Not in her ancient mode, sedate and slow,</span>
<span class="i0">As when she came, the mind she knew to know;</span>
<span class="i0">Nor as, when list’ning half an hour before,</span>
<span class="i0">She twice or thrice tapp’d gently at the door;</span>
<span class="i0">But, all decorum cast in wrath aside,</span>
<span class="i0">“I think the devil’s in the man!” she cried;</span>
<span class="i0">“A huge tall sailor, with his tawny cheek,</span>
<span class="i0">And pitted face, will with my lady speak;</span>
<span class="i0">He grinn’d an ugly smile, and said he knew, <span class="linenum">210</span></span>
<span class="i0">Please you, my lady, ’twould be joy to you;</span>
<span class="i0">What must I answer?”&mdash;Trembling and distress’d</span>
<span class="i0">Sank the pale Dinah, by her fears oppress’d;</span>
<span class="i0">When thus alarm’d, and brooking no delay,</span>
<span class="i0">Swift to her room the stranger made his way.</span>
<span class="i2">“Revive, my love!” said he, “I’ve done thee harm,</span>
<span class="i0">Give me thy pardon,” and he look’d alarm;</span>
<span class="i0">Meantime the prudent Dinah had contrived</span>
<span class="i0">Her soul to question, and she then revived.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
<span class="i2">“See! my good friend,” and then she raised her head,&emsp;}<span class="linenum">220</span></span>
<span class="i0">“The bloom of life, the strength of youth is fled;<span class="ws8">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Living we die; to us the world is dead.<span class="ws16">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">We parted bless’d with health, and I am now</span>
<span class="i0">Age-struck and feeble, so I find art thou;</span>
<span class="i0">Thine eye is sunken, furrow’d is thy face,</span>
<span class="i0">And downward look’st thou&mdash;so we run our race;</span>
<span class="i0">And happier they, whose race is nearly run,</span>
<span class="i0">Their troubles over, and their duties done.”&mdash;</span>
<span class="i2">“True, lady, true, we are not girl and boy;</span>
<span class="i0">But time has left us something to enjoy.”&mdash; <span class="linenum">230</span></span>
<span class="i2">“What! thou hast learn’d my fortune?&mdash;yes, I live</span>
<span class="i0">To feel how poor the comforts wealth can give;</span>
<span class="i0">Thou too perhaps art wealthy; but our fate</span>
<span class="i0">Still mocks our wishes, wealth is come too late.”&mdash;</span>
<span class="i2">“To me nor late nor early; I am come</span>
<span class="i0">Poor as I left thee to my native home:</span>
<span class="i0">Nor yet,” said Rupert, “will I grieve; ’tis mine</span>
<span class="i0">To share thy comforts, and the glory thine;</span>
<span class="i0">For thou wilt gladly take that generous part</span>
<span class="i0">That both exalts and gratifies the heart; <span class="linenum">240</span></span>
<span class="i0">While mine rejoices.”&mdash;“Heavens!” return’d the maid,</span>
<span class="i0">“This talk to one so wither’d and decayed?</span>
<span class="i0">No! all my care is now to fit my mind</span>
<span class="i0">For other spousal, and to die resign’d.</span>
<span class="i0">As friend and neighbour, I shall hope to see</span>
<span class="i0">These noble views, this pious love in thee;</span>
<span class="i0">That we together may the change await,</span>
<span class="i0">Guides and spectators in each other’s fate;</span>
<span class="i0">When fellow-pilgrims, we shall daily crave</span>
<span class="i0">The mutual prayer that arms us for the grave.” <span class="linenum">250</span></span>
<span class="i2">Half angry, half in doubt, the lover gazed</span>
<span class="i0">On the meek maiden, by her speech amazed.</span>
<span class="i0">“Dinah,” said he, “dost thou respect thy vows?</span>
<span class="i0">What spousal mean’st thou?&mdash;thou art Rupert’s spouse;</span>
<span class="i0">The chance is mine to take, and thine to give;</span>
<span class="i0">But trifling this, if we together live.</span>
<span class="i0">Can I believe, that, after all the past,</span>
<span class="i0">Our vows, our loves, thou wilt be false at last?</span>
<span class="i0">Something thou hast&mdash;I know not what&mdash;in view;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
<span class="i0">I find thee pious&mdash;let me find thee true.”&mdash; <span class="linenum">260</span></span>
<span class="i1">“Ah! cruel this; but do, my friend, depart;</span>
<span class="i0">And to its feelings leave my wounded heart.”&mdash;</span>
<span class="i1">“Nay, speak at once; and, Dinah, let me know,</span>
<span class="i0">Mean’st thou to take me, now I’m wreck’d, in tow?</span>
<span class="i0">Be fair; nor longer keep me in the dark;</span>
<span class="i0">Am I forsaken for a trimmer spark?</span>
<span class="i0">Heav’n’s spouse thou art not; nor can I believe</span>
<span class="i0">That God accepts her who will man deceive.</span>
<span class="i0">True, I am shatter’d; I have service seen,</span>
<span class="i0">And service done, and have in trouble been; <span class="linenum">270</span></span>
<span class="i0">My cheek (it shames me not) has lost its red,</span>
<span class="i0">And the brown buff is o’er my features spread;</span>
<span class="i0">Perchance my speech is rude; for I among</span>
<span class="i0">Th’ untamed have been, in temper and in tongue;</span>
<span class="i0">Have been trepann’d, have lived in toil and care,</span>
<span class="i0">And wrought for wealth I was not doom’d to share;</span>
<span class="i0">It touch’d me deeply, for I felt a pride</span>
<span class="i0">In gaining riches for my destined bride.</span>
<span class="i0">Speak, then, my fate; for these my sorrows past,</span>
<span class="i0">Time lost, youth fled, hope wearied, and at last <span class="linenum">280</span></span>
<span class="i0">This doubt of thee&mdash;a childish thing to tell,</span>
<span class="i0">But certain truth&mdash;my very throat they swell;</span>
<span class="i0">They stop the breath, and but for shame could I</span>
<span class="i0">Give way to weakness, and with passion cry;</span>
<span class="i0">These are unmanly struggles, but I feel</span>
<span class="i0">This hour must end them, and perhaps will heal.”&mdash;</span>
<span class="i2">Here Dinah sigh’d as if afraid to speak&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">And then repeated&mdash;“They were frail and weak;</span>
<span class="i0">His soul she loved, and hoped he had the grace</span>
<span class="i0">To fix his thoughts upon a better place.” <span class="linenum">290</span></span>
<span class="i2">She ceased;&mdash;with steady glance, as if to see</span>
<span class="i0">The very root of this hypocrisy,</span>
<span class="i0">He her small fingers moulded in his hard</span>
<span class="i0">And bronzed broad hand; then told her, his regard,</span>
<span class="i0">His best respect were gone, but love had still</span>
<span class="i0">Hold in his heart, and govern’d yet the will&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Or he would curse her;&mdash;saying this, he threw <span class="ws4">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">The hand in scorn away, and bade adieu <span class="ws9">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">To every lingering hope, with every care in view.&emsp;}</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
<span class="i2">Proud and indignant, suffering, sick, and poor, <span class="linenum">300</span></span>
<span class="i0">He grieved unseen, and spoke of love no more&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Till all he felt in indignation died,</span>
<span class="i0">As hers had sunk in avarice and pride.</span>
<span class="i2">In health declining, as in mind distress’d,</span>
<span class="i0">To some in power his troubles he confess’d,</span>
<span class="i0">And shares a parish-gift;&mdash;at prayers he sees</span>
<span class="i0">The pious Dinah dropp’d upon her knees;</span>
<span class="i0">Thence as she walks the street with stately air,</span>
<span class="i0">As chance directs, oft meet the parted pair.</span>
<span class="i0">When he, with thickset coat of badge-man’s blue, <span class="linenum">310</span></span>
<span class="i0">Moves near her shaded silk of changeful hue;</span>
<span class="i0">When his thin locks of grey approach her braid,</span>
<span class="i0">A costly purchase made in beauty’s aid;</span>
<span class="i0">When his frank air, and his unstudied pace,<span class="ws12">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Are seen with her soft manner, air, and grace.<span class="ws10">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And his plain artless look with her sharp meaning face: &emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">It might some wonder in a stranger move,</span>
<span class="i0">How these together could have talk’d of love.</span>
<span class="i2">Behold them now!&mdash;see, there a tradesman stands,</span>
<span class="i0">And humbly hearkens to some fresh commands; <span class="linenum">320</span></span>
<span class="i0">He moves to speak, she interrupts him&mdash;“Stay,”</span>
<span class="i0">Her air expresses&mdash;“Hark to what I say!”</span>
<span class="i0">Ten paces off, poor Rupert on a seat</span>
<span class="i0">Has taken refuge from the noon-day heat,</span>
<span class="i0">His eyes on her intent, as if to find</span>
<span class="i0">What were the movements of that subtle mind;</span>
<span class="i0">How still! how earnest is he!&mdash;it appears</span>
<span class="i0">His thoughts are wand’ring through his earlier years;</span>
<span class="i0">Through years of fruitless labour, to the day</span>
<span class="i0">When all his earthly prospects died away. <span class="linenum">330</span></span>
<span class="i0">“Had I,” he thinks, “been wealthier of the two, <span class="ws13">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Would she have found me so unkind, untrue? <span class="ws14">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Or knows not man, when poor, what man when rich will do?&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">Yes, yes! I feel that I had faithful proved,</span>
<span class="i0">And should have soothed and raised her, bless’d and loved.”</span>
<span class="i2">But Dinah moves&mdash;she had observed before</span>
<span class="i0">The pensive Rupert at an humble door.</span>
<span class="i0">Some thoughts of pity raised by his distress,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Some feeling touch of ancient tenderness;</span>
<span class="i0">Religion, duty, urged the maid to speak <span class="linenum">340</span></span>
<span class="i0">In terms of kindness to a man so weak;</span>
<span class="i0">But pride forbad, and to return would prove</span>
<span class="i0">She felt the shame of his neglected love;</span>
<span class="i0">Nor wrapp’d in silence could she pass, afraid</span>
<span class="i0">Each eye should see her, and each heart upbraid.</span>
<span class="i0">One way remain’d&mdash;the way the Levite took,</span>
<span class="i0">Who without mercy could on misery look,</span>
<span class="i0">(A way perceived by craft, approved by pride):</span>
<span class="i0">She cross’d, and pass’d him on the other side.</span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A borough-bailiff, who to law was train’d,</span>
<span class="i0">A wife and sons in decent state maintain’d;</span>
<span class="i0">He had his way in life’s rough ocean steer’d,</span>
<span class="i0">And many a rock and coast of danger clear’d;</span>
<span class="i0">He saw where others fail’d, and care had he</span>
<span class="i0">Others in him should not such failings see;</span>
<span class="i0">His sons in various busy states were placed,</span>
<span class="i0">And all began the sweets of gain to taste,</span>
<span class="i0">Save John, the younger; who, of sprightly parts,</span>
<span class="i0">Felt not a love for money-making arts. <span class="linenum">10</span></span>
<span class="i0">In childhood feeble, he, for country air,</span>
<span class="i0">Had long resided with a rustic pair;</span>
<span class="i0">All round whose room were doleful ballads, songs,</span>
<span class="i0">Of lovers’ sufferings and of ladies’ wrongs;</span>
<span class="i0">Of peevish ghosts who came at dark midnight,</span>
<span class="i0">For breach of promise guilty men to fright;</span>
<span class="i0">Love, marriage, murder, were the themes, with these,</span>
<span class="i0">All that on idle, ardent spirits seize;</span>
<span class="i0">Robbers at land and pirates on the main,</span>
<span class="i0">Enchanters foil’d, spells broken, giants slain; <span class="linenum">20</span></span>
<span class="i0">Legends of love, with tales of halls and bowers, <span class="ws6">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Choice of rare songs, and garlands of choice flowers,&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">And all the hungry mind without a choice devours.<span class="ws4">}</span></span>
<span class="i2">From village-children kept apart by pride,</span>
<span class="i0">With such enjoyments, and without a guide,</span>
<span class="i0">Inspired by feelings all such works infused,</span>
<span class="i0">John snatch’d a pen, and wrote as he perused:</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
<span class="i0">With the like fancy he could make his knight</span>
<span class="i0">Slay half an host and put the rest to flight;</span>
<span class="i0">With the like knowledge, he could make him ride <span class="linenum">30</span></span>
<span class="i0">From isle to isle at Parthenissa’s side;</span>
<span class="i0">And with a heart yet free, no busy brain<span class="ws10">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Form’d wilder notions of delight and pain,<span class="ws8">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">The raptures smiles create, the anguish of disdain.&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i2">Such were the fruits of John’s poetic toil&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Weeds, but still proofs of vigour in the soil.</span>
<span class="i0">He nothing purposed but with vast delight,</span>
<span class="i0">Let Fancy loose, and wonder’d at her flight;</span>
<span class="i0">His notions of poetic worth were high,</span>
<span class="i0">And of his own still-hoarded poetry.&mdash; <span class="linenum">40</span></span>
<span class="i0">These to his father’s house he bore with pride,</span>
<span class="i0">A miser’s treasure, in his room to hide;</span>
<span class="i0">Till, spurr’d by glory, to a reading friend</span>
<span class="i0">He kindly show’d the sonnets he had penn’d.</span>
<span class="i0">With erring judgment, though with heart sincere,</span>
<span class="i0">That friend exclaim’d, “These beauties must appear.”</span>
<span class="i0">In Magazines they claim’d their share of fame,</span>
<span class="i0">Though undistinguish’d by their author’s name;</span>
<span class="i0">And with delight the young enthusiast found</span>
<span class="i0">The muse of ‘Marcus’ with applauses crown’d. <span class="linenum">50</span></span>
<span class="i0">This heard the father, and with some alarm;</span>
<span class="i0">“The boy,” said he, “will neither trade nor farm;</span>
<span class="i0">He for both law and physic is unfit;</span>
<span class="i0">Wit he may have, but cannot live on wit:</span>
<span class="i0">Let him his talents then to learning give,</span>
<span class="i0">Where verse is honour’d, and where poets live.”</span>
<span class="i2">John kept his terms at college unreproved,</span>
<span class="i0">Took his degree, and left the life he loved;</span>
<span class="i0">Not yet ordain’d, his leisure he employ’d</span>
<span class="i0">In the light labours he so much enjoy’d; <span class="linenum">60</span></span>
<span class="i0">His favourite notions and his daring views</span>
<span class="i0">Were cherish’d still, and he adored the Muse.</span>
<span class="i2">“A little time, and he should burst to light,</span>
<span class="i0">And admiration of the world excite;</span>
<span class="i0">And every friend, now cool and apt to blame</span>
<span class="i0">His fond pursuit, would wonder at his fame.”</span>
<span class="i0">When led by fancy, and from view retired,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
<span class="i0">He call’d before him all his heart desired;</span>

<span class="i0">And beauty next an ardent lover bless; <span class="linenum">70</span></span>
<span class="i0">For me the maid shall leave her nobler state,</span>
<span class="i0">Happy to raise and share her poet’s fate.”</span>
<span class="i0">He saw each day his father’s frugal board</span>
<span class="i0">With simple fare by cautious prudence stored;</span>
<span class="i0">Where each indulgence was foreweigh’d with care,</span>
<span class="i0">And the grand maxims were to save and spare.</span>
<span class="i0">Yet in his walks, his closet, and his bed,</span>
<span class="i0">All frugal cares and prudent counsels fled;</span>

<span class="i0">Slaves of the <i>ring</i> and <i>lamp</i>! what need of you,</span>
<span class="i0">When Fancy’s self such magic deeds can do?</span>
<span class="i2">Though rapt in visions of no vulgar kind,</span>
<span class="i0">To common subjects stoop’d our poet’s mind;</span>
<span class="i0">And oft, when wearied with more ardent flight,</span>
<span class="i0">He felt a spur satiric song to write;</span>
<span class="i0">A rival burgess his bold muse attack’d,</span>
<span class="i0">And whipp’d severely for a well-known fact;</span>
<span class="i0">For, while he seem’d to all demure and shy,</span>
<span class="i0">Our poet gazed at what was passing by; <span class="linenum">90</span></span>
<span class="i0">And ev’n his father smiled when playful wit,</span>
<span class="i0">From his young bard, some haughty object hit.</span>
<span class="i2">From ancient times the borough where they dwelt</span>
<span class="i0">Had mighty contest at elections felt.</span>
<span class="i0">Sir Godfrey Ball, ’tis true, had held in pay</span>
<span class="i0">Electors many for the trying day;</span>
<span class="i0">But in such golden chains to bind them all</span>
<span class="i0">Required too much for e’en Sir Godfrey Ball.</span>
<span class="i0">A member died, and, to supply his place,</span>
<span class="i0">Two heroes enter’d for th’ important race; <span class="linenum">100</span></span>
<span class="i0">Sir Godfrey’s friend and Earl Fitzdonnel’s son,</span>
<span class="i0">Lord Frederick Damer, both prepared to run;</span>
<span class="i0">And partial numbers saw with vast delight</span>
<span class="i0">Their good young lord oppose the proud old knight.</span>
<span class="i2">Our poet’s father, at a first request,</span>
<span class="i0">Gave the young lord his vote and interest,</span>
<span class="i0">And, what he could, our poet; for he stung</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The foe by verse satiric, said and sung.</span>
<span class="i0">Lord Frederick heard of all this youthful zeal,</span>
<span class="i0">And felt as lords upon a canvass feel; <span class="linenum">110</span></span>
<span class="i0">He read the satire, and he saw the use <span class="ws14">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">That such cool insult, and such keen abuse,<span class="ws10">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Might on the wavering minds of voting men produce;&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">Then, too, his praises were in contrast seen,</span>
<span class="i0">“A lord as noble as the knight was mean.”</span>
<span class="i2">“I much rejoice,” he cried, “such worth to find;</span>
<span class="i0">To this the world must be no longer blind;</span>
<span class="i0">His glory will descend from sire to son,</span>
<span class="i0">The Burns of English race, the happier Chatterton.”</span>
<span class="i0">Our poet’s mind, now hurried and elate, <span class="linenum">120</span></span>
<span class="i0">Alarm’d the anxious parent for his fate;</span>
<span class="i0">Who saw with sorrow, should their friend succeed,</span>
<span class="i0">That much discretion would the poet need.</span>
<span class="i2">Their friend succeeded, and repaid the zeal</span>
<span class="i0">The poet felt, and made opposers feel,</span>
<span class="i0">By praise (from lords how soothing and how sweet!)</span>
<span class="i0">And invitation to his noble seat.</span>
<span class="i0">The father ponder’d, doubtful if the brain</span>
<span class="i0">Of his proud boy such honour could sustain;</span>
<span class="i0">Pleased with the favours offer’d to a son, <span class="linenum">130</span></span>
<span class="i0">But seeing dangers few so ardent shun.</span>
<span class="i2">Thus, when they parted, to the youthful breast</span>
<span class="i0">The father’s fears were by his love impress’d:</span>
<span class="i0">“There you will find, my son, the courteous ease</span>
<span class="i0">That must subdue the soul it means to please;</span>
<span class="i0">That soft attention which ev’n beauty pays</span>
<span class="i0">To wake our passions, or provoke our praise;</span>
<span class="i0">There all the eye beholds will give delight,</span>
<span class="i0">Where every sense is flatter’d like the sight.</span>
<span class="i0">This is your peril; can you from such scene <span class="linenum">140</span></span>
<span class="i0">Of splendour part, and feel your mind serene,</span>
<span class="i0">And in the father’s humble state resume</span>
<span class="i0">The frugal diet and the narrow room?”</span>
<span class="i0">To this the youth with cheerful heart replied,</span>
<span class="i0">Pleased with the trial, but as yet untried;</span>
<span class="i0">And while professing patience, should he fail,</span>
<span class="i0">He suffer’d hope o’er reason to prevail.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
<span class="i2">Impatient, by the morning mail convey’d,</span>
<span class="i0">The happy guest his promised visit paid;</span>
<span class="i0">And now, arriving at the hall, he tried <span class="linenum">150</span></span>
<span class="i0">For air composed, serene and satisfied;</span>
<span class="i0">As he had practised in his room alone,</span>
<span class="i0">And there acquired a free and easy tone.</span>
<span class="i0">There he had said, “Whatever the degree</span>
<span class="i0">A man obtains, what more than man is he?”</span>
<span class="i0">And when arrived&mdash;“This room is but a room;</span>
<span class="i0">Can aught we see the steady soul o’ercome?</span>
<span class="i0">Let me in all a manly firmness show,</span>
<span class="i0">Upheld by talents, and their value know.”</span>
<span class="i2">This reason urged; but it surpass’d his skill <span class="linenum">160</span></span>
<span class="i0">To be in act as manly as in will:</span>
<span class="i0">When he his lordship and the lady saw,</span>
<span class="i0">Brave as he was, he felt oppress’d with awe;</span>
<span class="i0">And spite of verse, that so much praise had won,</span>
<span class="i0">The poet found he was the bailiff’s son.</span>
<span class="i2">But dinner came, and the succeeding hours</span>
<span class="i0">Fix’d his weak nerves, and raised his failing powers;</span>
<span class="i0">Praised and assured, he ventured once or twice</span>
<span class="i0">On some remark, and bravely broke the ice;</span>
<span class="i0">So that at night, reflecting on his words, <span class="linenum">170</span></span>
<span class="i0">He found in time, he might converse with lords.</span>
<span class="i2">Now was the sister of his patron seen&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">A lovely creature, with majestic mien;</span>
<span class="i0">Who, softly smiling while she look’d so fair,</span>
<span class="i0">Praised the young poet with such friendly air;</span>
<span class="i0">Such winning frankness in her looks express’d,</span>
<span class="i0">And such attention to her brother’s guest,</span>
<span class="i0">That so much beauty, join’d with speech so kind,</span>
<span class="i0">Raised strong emotions in the poet’s mind;</span>
<span class="i0">Till reason fail’d his bosom to defend <span class="linenum">180</span></span>
<span class="i0">From the sweet power of this enchanting friend.&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Rash boy! what hope thy frantic mind invades?</span>
<span class="i0">What love confuses, and what pride persuades?</span>
<span class="i0">Awake to truth! shouldst thou deluded feed</span>
<span class="i0">On hopes so groundless, thou art mad indeed.</span>
<span class="i2">What say’st thou, wise-one? “that all-powerful love</span>
<span class="i0">Can fortune’s strong impediments remove;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Nor is it strange that worth should wed to worth,</span>
<span class="i0">The pride of genius with the pride of birth.”</span>
<span class="i0">While thou art dreaming thus, the beauty spies <span class="linenum">190</span></span>
<span class="i0">Love in thy tremor, passion in thine eyes;</span>
<span class="i0">And, with th’ amusement pleased, of conquest vain,</span>
<span class="i0">She seeks her pleasure, careless of thy pain;</span>
<span class="i0">She gives thee praise to humble and confound,</span>
<span class="i0">Smiles to ensnare, and flatters thee to wound.</span>
<span class="i2">Why has she said that in the lowest state</span>
<span class="i0">The noble mind insures a noble fate?</span>
<span class="i0">And why thy daring mind to glory call?</span>
<span class="i0">That thou may’st dare and suffer, soar and fall.</span>
<span class="i0">Beauties are tyrants, and if they can reign, <span class="linenum">200</span></span>
<span class="i0">They have no feeling for their subject’s pain;</span>
<span class="i0">Their victim’s anguish gives their charms applause,</span>
<span class="i0">And their chief glory is the woe they cause.</span>
<span class="i0">Something of this was felt, in spite of love,</span>
<span class="i0">Which hope, in spite of reason, would remove.</span>
<span class="i2">Thus lived our youth, with conversation, books,</span>
<span class="i0">And Lady Emma’s soul-subduing looks;</span>
<span class="i0">Lost in delight, astonish’d at his lot, <span class="ws19">}</span></span>

<span class="i0">But through the island would the shame be spread,</span>
<span class="i0">Should the fair mistress deign with thee to wed.”</span>
<span class="i2">John saw not this; and many a week had pass’d, <span class="linenum">420</span></span>
<span class="i0">While the vain beauty held her victim fast;</span>
<span class="i0">The noble friend still condescension show’d,</span>
<span class="i0">And, as before, with praises overflow’d;</span>
<span class="i0">But his grave lady took a silent view</span>
<span class="i0">Of all that pass’d, and, smiling, pitied too.</span>
<span class="i2">Cold grew the foggy morn; the day was brief;</span>
<span class="i0">Loose on the cherry hung the crimson leaf;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The dew dwelt ever on the herb; the woods</span>
<span class="i0">Roar’d with strong blasts, with mighty showers the floods;</span>
<span class="i0">All green was vanish’d, save of pine and yew, <span class="linenum">430</span></span>
<span class="i0">That still display’d their melancholy hue;</span>
<span class="i0">Save the green holly with its berries red,</span>
<span class="i0">And the green moss that o’er the gravel spread.</span>
<span class="i2">To public views my lord must soon attend;</span>
<span class="i0">And soon the ladies&mdash;would they leave their friend?</span>
<span class="i0">The time was fix’d&mdash;approach’d&mdash;was near&mdash;was come,</span>
<span class="i0">The trying time that fill’d his soul with gloom.</span>
<span class="i0">Thoughtful our poet in the morning rose,</span>
<span class="i0">And cried, “One hour my fortune will disclose;</span>
<span class="i0">Terrific hour! from thee have I to date <span class="linenum">440</span></span>
<span class="i0">Life’s loftier views, or my degraded state;</span>
<span class="i0">For now to be what I have been before</span>
<span class="i0">Is so to fall, that I can rise no more.”</span>
<span class="i2">The morning meal was past, and all around</span>
<span class="i0">The mansion rang with each discordant sound;</span>
<span class="i0">Haste was in every foot, and every look</span>
<span class="i0">The trav’ller’s joy for London-journey spoke.</span>
<span class="i0">Not so our youth; whose feelings, at the noise</span>
<span class="i0">Of preparation, had no touch of joys;</span>
<span class="i0">He pensive stood, and saw each carriage drawn, <span class="linenum">450</span></span>
<span class="i0">With lackeys mounted, ready on the lawn.</span>
<span class="i0">The ladies came; and John in terror threw</span>
<span class="i0">One painful glance, and then his eyes withdrew;</span>
<span class="i0">Not with such speed, but he in other eyes</span>
<span class="i0">With anguish read&mdash;“I pity but despise&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Unhappy boy! presumptuous scribbler!&mdash;you</span>
<span class="i0">To dream such dreams!&mdash;be sober, and adieu!”</span>
<span class="i2">Then came the noble friend&mdash;“And will my lord</span>
<span class="i0">Vouchsafe no comfort? drop no soothing word?</span>
<span class="i0">Yes, he must speak:” he speaks, “My good young friend,&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">You know my views; upon my care depend; <span class="linenum">461</span></span>
<span class="i0">My hearty thanks to your good father pay,</span>
<span class="i0">And be a student.&mdash;Harry, drive away.”</span>
<span class="i2">Stillness reign’d all around; of late so full,</span>
<span class="i0">The busy scene deserted now and dull.</span>
<span class="i0">Stern is his nature who forbears to feel</span>
<span class="i0">Gloom o’er his spirits on such trials steal;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Most keenly felt our poet as he went</span>
<span class="i0">From room to room without a fix’d intent;</span>
<span class="i0">“And here,” he thought, “I was caress’d; admired <span class="linenum">470</span></span>
<span class="i0">Were here my songs; she smiled, and I aspired:</span>
<span class="i0">The change how grievous!” As he mused, a dame</span>
<span class="i0">Busy and peevish to her duties came;</span>
<span class="i0">Aside the tables and the chairs she drew,</span>
<span class="i0">And sang and mutter’d in the poet’s view:&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“This was her fortune; here they leave the poor;</span>
<span class="i0">Enjoy themselves, and think of us no more;</span>
<span class="i0">I had a promise&mdash;” here his pride and shame</span>
<span class="i0">Urged him to fly from this familiar dame;</span>
<span class="i0">He gave one farewell look, and by a coach <span class="linenum">480</span></span>
<span class="i0">Reach’d his own mansion at the night’s approach.</span>
<span class="i2">His father met him with an anxious air,</span>
<span class="i0">Heard his sad tale, and check’d what seem’d despair;</span>
<span class="i0">Hope was in him corrected, but alive;</span>
<span class="i0">My lord would something for a friend contrive;</span>
<span class="i0">His word was pledged; our hero’s feverish mind</span>
<span class="i0">Admitted this, and half his grief resign’d.</span>
<span class="i0">But when three months had fled, and every day</span>
<span class="i0">Drew from the sickening hopes their strength away,</span>
<span class="i0">The youth became abstracted, pensive, dull; <span class="linenum">490</span></span>
<span class="i0">He utter’d nothing, though his heart was full.</span>
<span class="i0">Teased by inquiring words and anxious looks,</span>
<span class="i0">And all forgetful of his muse and books,</span>
<span class="i0">Awake he mourn’d, but in his sleep perceived</span>
<span class="i0">A lovely vision that his pain relieved;</span>
<span class="i0">His soul transported, hail’d the happy seat,</span>
<span class="i0">Where once his pleasure was so pure and sweet;</span>
<span class="i0">Where joys departed came in blissful view,</span>
<span class="i0">Till reason wak’d, and not a joy he knew.</span>
<span class="i2">Questions now vex’d his spirit, most from those <span class="linenum">500</span></span>
<span class="i0">Who are called friends, because they are not foes.</span>
<span class="i0">“John!” they would say; he, starting, turn’d around;</span>
<span class="i0">“John!” there was something shocking in the sound;</span>
<span class="i0">Ill brook’d he then the pert familiar phrase,</span>
<span class="i0">The untaught freedom, and th’ inquiring gaze;</span>
<span class="i0">Much was his temper touch’d, his spleen provoked,</span>
<span class="i0">When ask’d how ladies talk’d, or walk’d, or look’d?</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
<span class="i0">What said my lord of politics? how spent</span>
<span class="i0">He there his time? and was he glad he went?”</span>
<span class="i2">At length a letter came, both cool and brief, <span class="linenum">510</span></span>
<span class="i0">But still it gave the burthen’d heart relief:</span>
<span class="i0">Though not inspired by lofty hopes, the youth</span>
<span class="i0">Placed much reliance on Lord Frederick’s truth;</span>
<span class="i0">Summon’d to town, he thought the visit one</span>
<span class="i0">Where something fair and friendly would be done;</span>
<span class="i0">Although he judged not, as before his fall,</span>
<span class="i0">When all was love and promise at the hall.</span>
<span class="i2">Arrived in town, he early sought to know</span>
<span class="i0">The fate such dubious friendship would bestow;</span>
<span class="i0">At a tall building, trembling, he appear’d, <span class="linenum">520</span></span>
<span class="i0">And his low rap was indistinctly heard;</span>
<span class="i0">A well-known servant came&mdash;“A while,” said he,</span>
<span class="i0">“Be pleased to wait; my lord has company.”</span>
<span class="i2">Alone our hero sate; the news in hand,</span>
<span class="i0">Which, though he read, he could not understand.</span>
<span class="i0">Cold was the day; in days so cold as these</span>
<span class="i0">There needs a fire, where minds and bodies freeze;</span>
<span class="i0">The vast and echoing room, the polish’d grate,</span>
<span class="i0">The crimson chairs, the sideboard with its plate;</span>
<span class="i0">The splendid sofa, which, though made for rest, <span class="linenum">530</span></span>
<span class="i0">He then had thought it freedom to have press’d;</span>
<span class="i0">The shining tables, curiously inlaid,</span>
<span class="i0">Were all in comfortless proud style display’d;</span>
<span class="i0">And to the troubled feelings terror gave,</span>
<span class="i0">That made the once-dear friend the sick’ning slave.</span>
<span class="i2">“Was he forgotten?” Thrice upon his ear</span>
<span class="i0">Struck the loud clock, yet no relief was near;</span>
<span class="i0">Each rattling carriage, and each thundering stroke</span>
<span class="i0">On the loud door, the dream of fancy broke;</span>
<span class="i0">Oft as a servant chanced the way to come, <span class="linenum">540</span></span>
<span class="i0">“Brings he a message?” no! he pass’d the room.</span>
<span class="i0">At length ’tis certain; “Sir you will attend</span>
<span class="i0">At twelve on Thursday!” Thus the day had end.</span>
<span class="i2">Vex’d by these tedious hours of needless pain,</span>
<span class="i0">John left the noble mansion with disdain;</span>
<span class="i0">For there was something in that still, cold place,</span>
<span class="i0">That seem’d to threaten and portend disgrace.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
<span class="i2">Punctual again the modest rap declared</span>
<span class="i0">The youth attended; then was all prepared:</span>
<span class="i0">For the same servant, by his lord’s command, <span class="linenum">550</span></span>
<span class="i0">A paper offer’d to his trembling hand.</span>
<span class="i0">“No more!” he cried; “disdains he to afford</span>
<span class="i0">One kind expression, one consoling word?”</span>
<span class="i2">With troubled spirit he began to read</span>
<span class="i0">That “In the church my lord could not succeed;”</span>
<span class="i0">Who had “to peers of either kind applied,</span>
<span class="i0">And was with dignity and grace denied;</span>
<span class="i0">While his own livings were by men possess’d,</span>
<span class="i0">Not likely in their chancels yet to rest;</span>
<span class="i0">And therefore, all things weigh’d (as he, my lord, <span class="linenum">560</span></span>
<span class="i0">Had done maturely, and he pledged his word),</span>
<span class="i0">Wisdom it seem’d for John to turn his view</span>
<span class="i0">To busier scenes, and bid the church adieu!”</span>
<span class="i2">Here grieved the youth; he felt his father’s pride</span>
<span class="i0">Must with his own be shock’d and mortified;</span>
<span class="i0">But when he found his future comforts placed</span>
<span class="i0">Where he, alas! conceived himself disgraced&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">In some appointment on the London quays,</span>
<span class="i0">He bade farewell to honour and to ease;</span>
<span class="i0">His spirit fell; and, from that hour assured <span class="linenum">570</span></span>
<span class="i0">How vain his dreams, he suffer’d and was cured.</span>
<span class="i2">Our poet hurried on, with wish to fly</span>
<span class="i0">From all mankind, to be conceal’d, and die.</span>
<span class="i0">Alas! what hopes, what high romantic views <span class="ws17">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Did that one visit to the soul infuse, <span class="ws24">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Which cherish’d with such love, ’twas worse than death to lose!&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">Still he would strive, though painful was the strife,</span>
<span class="i0">To walk in this appointed road of life;</span>
<span class="i0">On these low duties duteous he would wait,</span>
<span class="i0">And patient bear the anguish of his fate. <span class="linenum">580</span></span>
<span class="i0">Thanks to the patron, but of coldest kind,</span>
<span class="i0">Express’d the sadness of the poet’s mind;</span>
<span class="i0">Whose heavy hours were pass’d with busy men,</span>
<span class="i0">In the dull practice of th’ official pen;</span>
<span class="i0">Who to superiors must in time impart</span>
<span class="i0">(The custom this) his progress in their art.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But so had grief on his perception wrought,</span>
<span class="i0">That all unheeded were the duties taught;</span>
<span class="i0">No answers gave he when his trial came,</span>
<span class="i0">Silent he stood, but suffering without shame; <span class="linenum">590</span></span>
<span class="i0">And they observed that words severe or kind</span>
<span class="i0">Made no impression on his wounded mind;</span>
<span class="i0">For all perceived from whence his failure rose&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Some grief whose cause he deign’d not to disclose.</span>
<span class="i0">A soul averse from scenes and works so new;</span>
<span class="i0">Fear, ever shrinking from the vulgar crew;</span>
<span class="i0">Distaste for each mechanic law and rule,</span>
<span class="i0">Thoughts of past honour and a patron cool;</span>
<span class="i0">A grieving parent, and a feeling mind,</span>
<span class="i0">Timid and ardent, tender and refined: <span class="linenum">600</span></span>
<span class="i0">These all with mighty force the youth assail’d,</span>
<span class="i0">Till his soul fainted, and his reason fail’d.</span>
<span class="i0">When this was known, and some debate arose</span>
<span class="i0">How they who saw it should the fact disclose,</span>
<span class="i0">He found their purpose, and in terror fled</span>
<span class="i0">From unseen kindness, with mistaken dread.</span>
<span class="i2">Meantime the parent was distress’d to find</span>
<span class="i0">His son no longer for a priest design’d;</span>
<span class="i0">But still he gain’d some comfort by the news</span>
<span class="i0">Of John’s promotion, though with humbler views; <span class="linenum">610</span></span>
<span class="i0">For he conceived that in no distant time</span>
<span class="i0">The boy would learn to scramble and to climb.</span>
<span class="i0">He little thought a son, his hope and pride,</span>
<span class="i0">His favour’d boy, was now a home denied:</span>
<span class="i0">Yes! while the parent was intent to trace</span>
<span class="i0">How men in office climb from place to place,</span>
<span class="i0">By day, by night, o’er moor and heath and hill,&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">Roved the sad youth, with ever-changing will, <span class="ws2">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Of every aid bereft, exposed to every ill.<span class="ws7">}</span></span>
<span class="i2">Thus as he sate, absorb’d in all the care <span class="linenum">620</span></span>
<span class="i0">And all the hope that anxious fathers share,</span>
<span class="i0">A friend abruptly to his presence brought,</span>
<span class="i0">With trembling hand, the subject of his thought,</span>
<span class="i0">Whom he had found afflicted and subdued</span>
<span class="i0">By hunger, sorrow, cold, and solitude.</span>
<span class="i2">Silent he enter’d the forgotten room</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
<span class="i0">As ghostly forms may be conceived to come;</span>
<span class="i0">With sorrow-shrunken face and hair upright,</span>
<span class="i0">He look’d dismay, neglect, despair, affright;</span>
<span class="i0">But, dead to comfort, and on misery thrown, <span class="linenum">630</span></span>
<span class="i0">His parent’s loss he felt not, nor his own.</span>
<span class="i2">The good man, struck with horror, cried aloud,</span>
<span class="i0">And drew around him an astonish’d crowd;</span>
<span class="i0">The sons and servants to the father ran,</span>
<span class="i0">To share the feelings of the grieved old man.</span>
<span class="i2">“Our brother, speak!” they all exclaim’d; “explain</span>
<span class="i0">Thy grief, thy suffering;”&mdash;but they ask’d in vain:</span>
<span class="i0">The friend told all he knew; and all was known,</span>
<span class="i0">Save the sad causes whence the ills had grown.</span>
<span class="i0">But, if obscure the cause, they all agreed <span class="linenum">640</span></span>
<span class="i0">From rest and kindness must the cure proceed:</span>
<span class="i0">And he was cured; for quiet, love, and care,</span>
<span class="i0">Strove with the gloom, and broke on the despair.</span>
<span class="i0">Yet slow their progress; and, as vapours move</span>
<span class="i0">Dense and reluctant from the wintry grove;</span>
<span class="i0">All is confusion till the morning light</span>
<span class="i0">Gives the dim scene obscurely to the sight;</span>
<span class="i0">More and yet more defined the trunks appear,</span>
<span class="i0">Till the wild prospect stands distinct and clear&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">So the dark mind of our young poet grew <span class="linenum">650</span></span>
<span class="i0">Clear and sedate; the dreadful mist withdrew;</span>
<span class="i0">And he resembled that bleak wintry scene,</span>
<span class="i0">Sad, though unclouded; dismal, though serene.</span>
<span class="i2">At times he utter’d, “What a dream was mine!</span>
<span class="i0">And what a prospect! glorious and divine!</span>
<span class="i0">Oh! in that room, and on that night, to see</span>
<span class="i0">These looks, that sweetness beaming all on me;</span>
<span class="i0">That syren-flattery&mdash;and to send me then,</span>
<span class="i0">Hope-raised and soften’d, to those heartless men;</span>
<span class="i0">That dark-brow’d stern director, pleased to show <span class="linenum">660</span></span>
<span class="i0">Knowledge of subjects I disdain’d to know;</span>
<span class="i0">Cold and controlling&mdash;but ’tis gone, ’tis past;</span>
<span class="i0">I had my trial, and have peace at last.”</span>
<span class="i2">Now grew the youth resign’d; he bade adieu</span>
<span class="i0">To all that hope, to all that fancy drew;</span>
<span class="i0">His frame was languid, and the hectic heat</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Flush’d on his pallid face, and countless beat</span>
<span class="i0">The quick’ning pulse, and faint the limbs that bore</span>
<span class="i0">The slender form that soon would breathe no more.</span>
<span class="i2">Then hope of holy kind the soul sustain’d, <span class="linenum">670</span></span>
<span class="i0">And not a lingering thought of earth remain’d;</span>
<span class="i0">Now Heaven had all, and he could smile at love,</span>
<span class="i0">And the wild sallies of his youth reprove;</span>
<span class="i0">Then could he dwell upon the tempting days,</span>
<span class="i0">The proud aspiring thought, the partial praise;</span>
<span class="i0">Victorious now, his worldly views were closed,</span>
<span class="i0">And on the bed of death the youth reposed.</span>
<span class="i2">The father grieved&mdash;but, as the poet’s heart</span>
<span class="i0">Was all unfitted for his earthly part;</span>
<span class="i0">As, he conceived, some other haughty fair <span class="linenum">680</span></span>
<span class="i0">Would, had he lived, have led him to despair;</span>
<span class="i0">As, with this fear, the silent grave shut out</span>
<span class="i0">All feverish hope, and all tormenting doubt;</span>
<span class="i0">While the strong faith the pious youth possess’d,</span>
<span class="i0">His hope enlivening, gave his sorrows rest:</span>
<span class="i0">Soothed by these thoughts, he felt a mournful joy</span>
<span class="i0">For his aspiring and devoted boy.</span>
<span class="i2">Meantime the news through various channels spread:</span>
<span class="i0">The youth, once favour’d with such praise, was dead.</span>
<span class="i0">“Emma,” the lady cried, “my words attend, <span class="linenum">690</span></span>
<span class="i0">Your syren-smiles have kill’d your humble friend;</span>
<span class="i0">The hope you raised can now delude no more,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor charms, that once inspired, can now restore.”</span>
<span class="i2">Faint was the flush of anger and of shame,</span>
<span class="i0">That o’er the cheek of conscious beauty came.</span>
<span class="i0">“You censure not,” said she, “the sun’s bright rays,</span>
<span class="i0">When fools imprudent dare the dangerous gaze;</span>
<span class="i0">And, should a stripling look till he were blind,</span>
<span class="i0">You would not justly call the light unkind.&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">But is he dead? and am I to suppose <span class="linenum">700</span></span>
<span class="i0">The power of poison in such looks as those?”</span>
<span class="i0">She spoke, and, pointing to the mirror, cast</span>
<span class="i0">A pleased gay glance, and curtsied as she pass’d.</span>
<span class="i2">My lord, to whom the poet’s fate was told,</span>
<span class="i0">Was much affected, for a man so cold.</span>
<span class="i0">“Dead!” said his lordship, “run distracted, mad!</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Upon my soul I’m sorry for the lad;</span>
<span class="i0">And now, no doubt, th’ obliging world will say</span>
<span class="i0">That my harsh usage help’d him on his way.</span>
<span class="i0">What! I suppose, I should have nursed his muse, <span class="linenum">710</span></span>
<span class="i0">And with champagne have brighten’d up his views:</span>
<span class="i0">Then had he made me famed my whole life long,</span>
<span class="i0">And stunn’d my ears with gratitude and song.</span>
<span class="i0">Still, should the father hear that I regret</span>
<span class="i0">Our joint misfortune&mdash;Yes! I’ll not forget.”&mdash;</span>
<span class="i2">Thus they.&mdash;The father to his grave convey’d</span>
<span class="i0">The son he loved, and his last duties paid.</span>
<span class="i2">“There lies my boy,” he cried, “of care bereft,</span>
<span class="i0">And, Heav’n be praised, I’ve not a genius left:</span>
<span class="i0">No one among ye, sons! is doom’d to live <span class="linenum">720</span></span>
<span class="i0">On high-raised hopes of what the great may give;</span>
<span class="i0">None, with exalted views and fortunes mean,</span>
<span class="i0">To die in anguish, or to live in spleen.</span>
<span class="i0">Your pious brother soon escaped the strife</span>
<span class="i0">Of such contention, but it cost his life;</span>
<span class="i0">You then, my sons, upon yourselves depend,</span>
<span class="i0">And in your own exertions find the friend.”</span>

<p class="f110"><i>THE FRANK COURTSHIP.</i></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Grave Jonas Kindred, Sybil Kindred’s sire,</span>
<span class="i0">Was six feet high, and look’d six inches higher;</span>
<span class="i0">Erect, morose, determined, solemn, slow,</span>
<span class="i0">Who knew the man, could never cease to know;</span>
<span class="i0">His faithful spouse, when Jonas was not by,</span>
<span class="i0">Had a firm presence and a steady eye;</span>
<span class="i0">But with her husband dropp’d her look and tone,</span>
<span class="i0">And Jonas ruled unquestion’d and alone.</span>
<span class="i2">He read, and oft would quote the sacred words,</span>
<span class="i0">How pious husbands of their wives were lords; <span class="linenum">10</span></span>
<span class="i0">Sarah called Abraham lord! and who could be,</span>
<span class="i0">So Jonas thought, a greater man than he?</span>
<span class="i0">Himself he view’d with undisguised respect,</span>
<span class="i0">And never pardon’d freedom or neglect.</span>
<span class="i2">They had one daughter, and this favourite child</span>
<span class="i0">Had oft the father of his spleen beguiled;</span>
<span class="i0">Soothed by attention from her early years,</span>
<span class="i0">She gain’d all wishes by her smiles or tears:</span>
<span class="i0">But Sybil then was in that playful time,</span>
<span class="i0">When contradiction is not held a crime; <span class="linenum">20</span></span>
<span class="i0">When parents yield their children idle praise</span>
<span class="i0">For faults corrected in their after days.</span>
<span class="i2">Peace in the sober house of Jonas dwelt,</span>
<span class="i0">Where each his duty and his station felt:</span>
<span class="i0">Yet not that peace some favour’d mortals find,</span>
<span class="i0">In equal views and harmony of mind;</span>
<span class="i0">Not the soft peace that blesses those who love,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Where all with one consent in union move;</span>
<span class="i0">But it was that which one superior will</span>
<span class="i0">Commands, by making all inferiors still; <span class="linenum">30</span></span>
<span class="i0">Who bids all murmurs, all objections cease,</span>
<span class="i0">And with imperious voice announces&mdash;Peace!</span>
<span class="i2">They were, to wit, a remnant of that crew,</span>
<span class="i0">Who, as their foes maintain, their sovereign slew:</span>
<span class="i0">An independent race, precise, correct,</span>
<span class="i0">Who ever married in the kindred sect.</span>
<span class="i0">No son or daughter of their order wed</span>
<span class="i0">A friend to England’s king who lost his head;</span>
<span class="i0">Cromwell was still their saint, and, when they met,</span>
<span class="i0">They mourn’d that saints<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
                 were not our rulers yet. <span class="linenum">40</span></span>
<span class="i2">Fix’d were their habits; they arose betimes,</span>
<span class="i0">Then pray’d their hour, and sang their party-rhymes:</span>
<span class="i0">Their meals were plenteous, regular, and plain;</span>
<span class="i0">The trade of Jonas brought him constant gain;</span>
<span class="i0">Vender of hops and malt, of coals and corn&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">And, like his father, he was merchant born.</span>
<span class="i0">Neat was their house; each table, chair, and stool,</span>
<span class="i0">Stood in its place, or moving moved by rule;</span>
<span class="i0">No lively print or picture graced the room;</span>
<span class="i0">A plain brown paper lent its decent gloom; <span class="linenum">50</span></span>
<span class="i0">But here the eye, in glancing round, survey’d</span>
<span class="i0">A small recess that seem’d for china made;</span>
<span class="i0">Such pleasing pictures seem’d this pencill’d ware,</span>
<span class="i0">That few would search for nobler objects there&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Yet, turn’d by chosen friends, and there appear’d</span>
<span class="i0">His stern, strong features, whom they all revered;</span>
<span class="i0">For there in lofty air was seen to stand</span>
<span class="i0">The bold protector of the conquer’d land;</span>
<span class="i0">Drawn in that look with which he wept and swore,</span>
<span class="i0">Turn’d out the members, and made fast the door, <span class="linenum">60</span></span>
<span class="i0">Ridding the house of every knave and drone;</span>
<span class="i0">Forced, though it grieved his soul, to rule alone.</span>
<span class="i0">The stern, still smile each friend, approving, gave;</span>
<span class="i0">Then turn’d the view, and all again were grave.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
<span class="i2">There stood a clock, though small the owner’s need&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">For habit told when all things should proceed.</span>
<span class="i0">Few their amusements, but, when friends appear’d,</span>
<span class="i0">They with the world’s distress their spirits cheer’d;</span>
<span class="i0">The nation’s guilt, that would not long endure</span>
<span class="i0">The reign of men so modest and so pure. <span class="linenum">70</span></span>
<span class="i0">Their town was large, and seldom pass’d a day</span>
<span class="i0">But some had fail’d, and others gone astray;</span>
<span class="i0">Clerks had absconded, wives eloped, girls flown</span>
<span class="i0">To Gretna-Green, or sons rebellious grown;</span>
<span class="i0">Quarrels and fires arose;&mdash;and it was plain</span>
<span class="i0">The times were bad; the saints had ceased to reign!</span>
<span class="i0">A few yet lived to languish and to mourn</span>
<span class="i0">For good old manners, never to return.</span>
<span class="i2">Jonas had sisters, and of these was one</span>
<span class="i0">Who lost a husband and an only son: <span class="linenum">80</span></span>
<span class="i0">Twelve months her sables she in sorrow wore,</span>
<span class="i0">And mourn’d so long that she could mourn no more.</span>
<span class="i0">Distant from Jonas, and from all her race,</span>
<span class="i0">She now resided in a lively place;</span>
<span class="i0">There, by the sect unseen, at whist she play’d,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor was of churchmen or their church afraid.</span>
<span class="i0">If much of this the graver brother heard,</span>
<span class="i0">He something censured, but he little fear’d;</span>
<span class="i0">He knew her rich and frugal; for the rest,</span>
<span class="i0">He felt no care, or, if he felt, suppress’d; <span class="linenum">90</span></span>
<span class="i0">Nor, for companion when she ask’d her niece,</span>
<span class="i0">Had he suspicions that disturbed his peace;</span>
<span class="i0">Frugal and rich, these virtues as a charm</span>
<span class="i0">Preserved the thoughtful man from all alarm;</span>
<span class="i0">An infant yet, she soon would home return,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor stay the manners of the world to learn;</span>
<span class="i0">Meantime his boys would all his care engross,</span>
<span class="i0">And be his comforts if he felt the loss.</span>
<span class="i2">The sprightly Sybil, pleased and unconfined,</span>
<span class="i0">Felt the pure pleasure of the op’ning mind: <span class="linenum">100</span></span>
<span class="i0">All here was gay and cheerful&mdash;all at home</span>
<span class="i0">Unvaried quiet and unruffled gloom.</span>
<span class="i0">There were no changes, and amusements few;</span>
<span class="i0">Here, all was varied, wonderful, and new;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
<span class="i0">There were plain meals, plain dresses, and grave looks&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Here, gay companions and amusing books;</span>
<span class="i0">And the young beauty soon began to taste</span>
<span class="i0">The light vocations of the scene she graced.</span>
<span class="i2">A man of business feels it as a crime</span>
<span class="i0">On calls domestic to consume his time; <span class="linenum">110</span></span>
<span class="i0">Yet this grave man had not so cold a heart,</span>
<span class="i0">But with his daughter he was grieved to part;</span>
<span class="i0">And he demanded that in every year</span>
<span class="i0">The aunt and niece should at his house appear.</span>
<span class="i2">“Yes! we must go, my child, and by our dress</span>
<span class="i0">A grave conformity of mind express;</span>
<span class="i0">Must sing at meeting, and from cards refrain,</span>
<span class="i0">The more t’ enjoy when we return again.”</span>
<span class="i2">Thus spake the aunt, and the discerning child</span>
<span class="i0">Was pleased to learn how fathers are beguiled. <span class="linenum">120</span></span>
<span class="i0">Her artful part the young dissembler took,</span>
<span class="i0">And from the matron caught th’ approving look.</span>
<span class="i0">When thrice the friends had met, excuse was sent</span>
<span class="i0">For more delay, and Jonas was content;</span>
<span class="i0">Till a tall maiden by her sire was seen,</span>
<span class="i0">In all the bloom and beauty of sixteen;</span>
<span class="i0">He gazed admiring;&mdash;she, with visage prim,</span>
<span class="i0">Glanced an arch look of gravity on him;</span>
<span class="i0">For she was gay at heart, but wore disguise,</span>
<span class="i0">And stood a vestal in her father’s eyes&mdash; <span class="linenum">130</span></span>
<span class="i0">Pure, pensive, simple, sad; the damsel’s heart,</span>
<span class="i0">When Jonas praised, reproved her for the part;</span>
<span class="i0">For Sybil, fond of pleasure, gay and light,</span>
<span class="i0">Had still a secret bias to the right;</span>
<span class="i0">Vain as she was&mdash;and flattery made her vain&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Her simulation gave her bosom pain.</span>
<span class="i2">Again return’d, the matron and the niece</span>
<span class="i0">Found the late quiet gave their joy increase;</span>
<span class="i0">The aunt, infirm, no more her visits paid,</span>
<span class="i0">But still with her sojourn’d the favourite maid. <span class="linenum">140</span></span>
<span class="i0">Letters were sent when franks could be procured;</span>
<span class="i0">And, when they could not, silence was endured.</span>
<span class="i0">All were in health, and, if they older grew,</span>
<span class="i0">It seem’d a fact that none among them knew;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The aunt and niece still led a pleasant life,</span>
<span class="i0">And quiet days had Jonas and his wife.</span>
<span class="i2">Near him a widow dwelt of worthy fame:</span>
<span class="i0">Like his her manners, and her creed the same.</span>
<span class="i0">The wealth her husband left her care retain’d</span>
<span class="i0">For one tall youth, and widow she remained; <span class="linenum">150</span></span>
<span class="i0">His love respectful all her care repaid,</span>
<span class="i0">Her wishes watch’d, and her commands obey’d.</span>
<span class="i2">Sober he was and grave from early youth,</span>
<span class="i0">Mindful of forms, but more intent on truth;</span>
<span class="i0">In a light drab he uniformly dress’d,</span>
<span class="i0">And look serene th’ unruffled mind express’d;</span>
<span class="i0">A hat with ample verge his brows o’erspread,</span>
<span class="i0">And his brown locks curl’d graceful on his head;</span>
<span class="i0">Yet might observers in his speaking eye<span class="ws17">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Some observation, some acuteness spy; <span class="ws17">}</span><span class="linenum">160</span></span>
<span class="i0">The friendly thought it keen, the treacherous deem’d it sly.&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">Yet not a crime could foe or friend detect;</span>
<span class="i0">His actions all were, like his speech, correct;</span>
<span class="i0">And they who jested on a mind so sound,</span>
<span class="i0">Upon his virtues must their laughter found:</span>
<span class="i0">‘Chaste, sober, solemn,’ and ‘devout’ they named</span>
<span class="i0">Him who was thus, and not of <i>this</i> ashamed.</span>
<span class="i2">Such were the virtues Jonas found in one</span>
<span class="i0">In whom he warmly wish’d to find a son.</span>
<span class="i0">Three years had pass’d since he had Sybil seen; <span class="linenum">170</span></span>
<span class="i0">But she was doubtless what she once had been&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Lovely and mild, obedient and discreet:</span>
<span class="i0">The pair must love whenever they should meet;</span>
<span class="i0">Then, ere the widow or her son should choose</span>
<span class="i0">Some happier maid, he would explain his views.</span>
<span class="i0">Now she, like him, was politic and shrewd,</span>
<span class="i0">With strong desire of lawful gain embued;</span>
<span class="i0">To all he said, she bow’d with much respect,</span>
<span class="i0">Pleased to comply, yet seeming to reject;</span>
<span class="i0">Cool, and yet eager, each admired the strength <span class="linenum">180</span></span>
<span class="i0">Of the opponent, and agreed at length.</span>
<span class="i0">As a drawn battle shows to each a force,</span>
<span class="i0">Powerful as his, he honours it of course:</span>
<span class="i0">So in these neighbours, each the power discern’d,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And gave the praise that was to each return’d.</span>
<span class="i2">Jonas now ask’d his daughter; and the aunt,</span>
<span class="i0">Though loth to lose her, was obliged to grant.&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">But would not Sybil to the matron cling,</span>
<span class="i0">And fear to leave the shelter of her wing?</span>
<span class="i0">No! in the young there lives a love of change, <span class="linenum">190</span></span>
<span class="i0">And to the easy they prefer the strange!</span>
<span class="i0">Then too the joys she once pursued with zeal,</span>
<span class="i0">From whist and visits sprung, she ceased to feel;</span>
<span class="i0">When with the matrons Sybil first sat down,</span>
<span class="i0">To cut for partners and to stake her crown,</span>
<span class="i0">This to the youthful maid preferment seem’d,</span>
<span class="i0">Who thought [that] woman she was then esteem’d;</span>
<span class="i0">But in few years, when she perceived, indeed,</span>
<span class="i0">The real woman to the girl succeed,</span>
<span class="i0">No longer tricks and honours fill’d her mind, <span class="linenum">200</span></span>
<span class="i0">But other feelings, not so well defined.</span>
<span class="i0">She then reluctant grew, and thought it hard,</span>
<span class="i0">To sit and ponder o’er an ugly card;</span>
<span class="i0">Rather the nut-tree shade the nymph preferr’d,</span>
<span class="i0">Pleased with the pensive gloom and evening bird;</span>
<span class="i0">Thither, from company retired, she took</span>
<span class="i0">The silent walk, or read the fav’rite book.</span>
<span class="i2">The father’s letter, sudden, short, and kind,</span>
<span class="i0">Awaked her wonder, and disturb’d her mind;</span>
<span class="i0">She found new dreams upon her fancy seize, <span class="linenum">210</span></span>
<span class="i0">Wild roving thoughts and endless reveries.</span>
<span class="i0">The parting came;&mdash;and, when the aunt perceived</span>
<span class="i0">The tears of Sybil, and how much she grieved,</span>
<span class="i0">To love for her that tender grief she laid,</span>
<span class="i0">That various, soft, contending passions made.</span>
<span class="i2">When Sybil rested in her father’s arms,</span>
<span class="i0">His pride exulted in a daughter’s charms;</span>
<span class="i0">A maid accomplish’d he was pleased to find,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor seem’d the form more lovely than the mind.</span>
<span class="i0">But when the fit of pride and fondness fled, <span class="linenum">220</span></span>
<span class="i0">He saw his judgment by his hopes misled;</span>
<span class="i0">High were the lady’s spirits, far more free</span>
<span class="i0">Her mode of speaking than a maid’s should be;</span>
<span class="i0">Too much, as Jonas thought, she seem’d to know,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And all her knowledge was disposed to show:</span>
<span class="i0">“Too gay her dress, like theirs who idly dote</span>
<span class="i0">On a young coxcomb, or a coxcomb’s coat;</span>
<span class="i0">In foolish spirits when our friends appear,</span>
<span class="i0">And vainly grave when not a man is near.”</span>
<span class="i2">Thus Jonas, adding to his sorrow blame, <span class="linenum">230</span></span>
<span class="i0">And terms disdainful to his sister’s name:&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“The sinful wretch has by her arts defiled</span>
<span class="i0">The ductile spirit of my darling child.”</span>
<span class="i2">“The maid is virtuous,” said the dame.&mdash;Quoth he,</span>
<span class="i0">“Let her give proof, by acting virtuously:</span>
<span class="i0">Is it in gaping when the elders pray?</span>
<span class="i0">In reading nonsense half a summer’s day?</span>
<span class="i0">In those mock forms that she delights to trace,</span>
<span class="i0">Or her loud laughs in Hezekiah’s face?</span>
<span class="i0">She&mdash;O Susannah!&mdash;to the world belongs;<span class="ws17">}</span><span class="linenum">240</span></span>
<span class="i0">She loves the follies of its idle throngs,<span class="ws20">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And reads soft tales of love, and sings love’s soft’ning songs.&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">But, as our friend is yet delay’d in town,</span>
<span class="i0">We must prepare her till the youth comes down;</span>
<span class="i0">You shall advise the maiden; I will threat;</span>
<span class="i0">Her fears and hopes may yield us comfort yet.”</span>
<span class="i2">Now the grave father took the lass aside,</span>
<span class="i0">Demanding sternly, “Wilt thou be a bride?”</span>
<span class="i0">She answer’d, calling up an air sedate,</span>
<span class="i0">“I have not vow’d against the holy state.” <span class="linenum">250</span></span>
<span class="i2">“No folly, Sybil,” said the parent; “know</span>
<span class="i0">What to their parents virtuous maidens owe:</span>
<span class="i0">A worthy, wealthy youth, whom I approve,</span>
<span class="i0">Must thou prepare to honour and to love.</span>
<span class="i0">Formal to thee his air and dress may seem,</span>
<span class="i0">But the good youth is worthy of esteem;</span>
<span class="i0">Shouldst thou with rudeness treat him, of disdain</span>
<span class="i0">Should he with justice or of slight complain,</span>
<span class="i0">Or of one taunting speech give certain proof:</span>
<span class="i0">Girl! I reject thee from my sober roof.” <span class="linenum">260</span></span>
<span class="i2">“My aunt,” said Sybil, “will with pride protect</span>
<span class="i0">One whom a father can for this reject;</span>
<span class="i0">Nor shall a formal, rigid, soul-less boy</span>
<span class="i0">My manners alter, or my views destroy!”</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
<span class="i2">Jonas [then] lifted up his hands on high,<span class="ws8">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And, utt’ring something ’twixt a groan and sigh,<span class="ws3">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Left the determined maid her doubtful mother by.&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i2">“Hear me,” she said; “incline thy heart, my child,</span>
<span class="i0">And fix thy fancy on a man so mild;</span>
<span class="i0">Thy father, Sybil, never could be moved <span class="linenum">270</span></span>
<span class="i0">By one who loved him, or by one he loved.</span>
<span class="i0">Union like ours is but a bargain made</span>
<span class="i0">By slave and tyrant&mdash;he will be obey’d,</span>
<span class="i0">Then calls the quiet comfort;&mdash;but thy youth</span>
<span class="i0">Is mild by nature, and as frank as truth.”</span>
<span class="i2">“But will he love?” said Sybil; “I am told</span>
<span class="i0">That these mild creatures are by nature cold.”</span>
<span class="i2">“Alas!” the matron answer’d, “much I dread</span>
<span class="i0">That dangerous love by which the young are led!</span>
<span class="i0">That love is earthy; you the creature prize, <span class="linenum">280</span></span>
<span class="i0">And trust your feelings and believe your eyes:</span>
<span class="i0">Can eyes and feelings inward worth descry?</span>
<span class="i0">No! my fair daughter, on our choice rely!</span>
<span class="i0">Your love, like that display’d upon the stage,</span>
<span class="i0">Indulged is folly, and opposed is rage;&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">More prudent love our sober couples show,</span>
<span class="i0">All that to mortal beings mortals owe.</span>
<span class="i0">All flesh is grass&mdash;before you give a heart,</span>
<span class="i0">Remember, Sybil, that in death you part;</span>
<span class="i0">And, should your husband die before your love, <span class="linenum">290</span></span>
<span class="i0">What needless anguish must a widow prove!</span>
<span class="i0">No! my fair child, let all such visions cease;</span>
<span class="i0">Yield but esteem, and only try for peace.”</span>
<span class="i2">“I must be loved,” said Sybil; “I must see</span>
<span class="i0">The man in terrors who aspires to me;</span>
<span class="i0">At my forbidding frown his heart must ache,</span>
<span class="i0">His tongue must falter, and his frame must shake;</span>
<span class="i0">And, if I grant him at my feet to kneel,</span>
<span class="i0">What trembling, fearful pleasure must he feel;</span>
<span class="i0">Nay, such the raptures that my smiles inspire, <span class="linenum">300</span></span>
<span class="i0">That reason’s self must for a time retire.”</span>
<span class="i2">“Alas! for good Josiah,” said the dame,</span>
<span class="i0">“These wicked thoughts would fill his soul with shame.</span>
<span class="i0">He kneel and tremble at a thing of dust!</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
<span class="i0">He cannot, child.”&mdash;The child replied, “He must.”</span>
<span class="i2">They ceased; the matron left her with a frown;</span>
<span class="i0">So Jonas met her when the youth came down.</span>
<span class="i0">“Behold,” said he, “thy future spouse attends;</span>
<span class="i0">Receive him, daughter, as the best of friends;</span>
<span class="i0">Observe, respect him&mdash;humble be each word, <span class="linenum">310</span></span>
<span class="i0">That welcomes home thy husband and thy lord.”</span>
<span class="i2">Forewarn’d, thought Sybil, with a bitter smile,</span>
<span class="i0">I shall prepare my manner and my style.</span>
<span class="i2">Ere yet Josiah enter’d on his task,</span>
<span class="i0">The father met him:&mdash;“Deign to wear a mask</span>
<span class="i0">A few dull days, Josiah&mdash;but a few&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">It is our duty, and the sex’s due;</span>
<span class="i0">I wore it once, and every grateful wife</span>
<span class="i0">Repays it with obedience through her life:</span>
<span class="i0">Have no regard to Sybil’s dress, have none<span class="ws11">}</span><span class="linenum">320</span></span>
<span class="i0">To her pert language, to her flippant tone:<span class="ws12">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Henceforward thou shalt rule unquestion’d and alone; &emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">And she thy pleasure in thy looks shall seek&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">How she shall dress, and whether she may speak.”</span>
<span class="i2">A sober smile return’d the youth, and said,</span>
<span class="i0">“Can I cause fear, who am myself afraid?”</span>
<span class="i2">Sybil, meantime, sat thoughtful in her room,</span>
<span class="i0">And often wonder’d&mdash;“Will the creature come?</span>
<span class="i0">Nothing shall tempt, shall force me to bestow</span>
<span class="i0">My hand upon him&mdash;yet I wish to know.” <span class="linenum">330</span></span>
<span class="i2">The door unclosed, and she beheld her sire</span>
<span class="i0">Lead in the youth, then hasten to retire.</span>
<span class="i0">“Daughter, my friend&mdash;my daughter, friend,” he cried,</span>
<span class="i0">And gave a meaning look, and stepp’d aside;</span>
<span class="i0">That look contain’d a mingled threat and prayer,</span>
<span class="i0">“Do take him, child&mdash;offend him, if you dare.”</span>
<span class="i2">The couple gazed&mdash;were silent; and the maid</span>
<span class="i0">Look’d in his face, to make the man afraid;</span>
<span class="i0">The man, unmoved, upon the maiden cast</span>
<span class="i0">A steady view&mdash;so salutation pass’d; <span class="linenum">340</span></span>
<span class="i0">But in this instant Sybil’s eye had seen</span>
<span class="i0">The tall fair person, and the still staid mien;</span>
<span class="i0">The glow that temp’rance o’er the cheek had spread,</span>
<span class="i0">Where the soft down half veil’d the purest red;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And the serene deportment that proclaim’d</span>
<span class="i0">A heart unspotted, and a life unblamed.</span>
<span class="i0">But then with these she saw attire too plain,</span>
<span class="i0">The pale brown coat, though worn without a stain;</span>
<span class="i0">The formal air, and something of the pride</span>
<span class="i0">That indicates the wealth it seems to hide; <span class="linenum">350</span></span>
<span class="i0">And looks that were not, she conceived, exempt</span>
<span class="i0">From a proud pity, or a sly contempt.</span>
<span class="i2">Josiah’s eyes had their employment too,</span>
<span class="i0">Engaged and soften’d by so bright a view:</span>
<span class="i0">A fair and meaning face, an eye of fire,</span>
<span class="i0">That check’d the bold, and made the free retire.</span>
<span class="i0">But then with these he mark’d the studied dress</span>
<span class="i0">And lofty air, that scorn or pride express;</span>
<span class="i0">With that insidious look, that seem’d to hide</span>
<span class="i0">In an affected smile the scorn and pride; <span class="linenum">360</span></span>
<span class="i0">And if his mind the virgin’s meaning caught, <span class="ws6">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">He saw a foe with treacherous purpose fraught&mdash;<span class="ws3">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Captive the heart to take, and to reject it caught.&emsp;&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i2">Silent they sate&mdash;thought Sybil, that he seeks</span>
<span class="i0">Something, no doubt; I wonder if he speaks.</span>
<span class="i0">Scarcely she wonder’d, when these accents fell</span>
<span class="i0">Slow in her ear&mdash;“Fair maiden, art thou well?”&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“Art thou physician?” she replied; “my hand,</span>
<span class="i0">My pulse, at least, shall be at thy command.”</span>
<span class="i2">She said&mdash;and saw, surprised, Josiah kneel, <span class="linenum">370</span></span>
<span class="i0">And gave his lips the offer’d pulse to feel;</span>
<span class="i0">The rosy colour rising in her cheek</span>
<span class="i0">Seem’d that surprise, unmix’d with wrath, to speak;</span>
<span class="i0">Then sternness she assumed, and&mdash;“Doctor, tell,</span>
<span class="i0">Thy words cannot alarm me&mdash;am I well?”</span>
<span class="i2">“Thou art,” said he; “and yet thy dress so light,</span>
<span class="i0">I do conceive, some danger must excite.”</span>
<span class="i0">“In whom?” said Sybil, with a look demure;</span>
<span class="i0">“In more,” said he, “than I expect to cure.</span>
<span class="i0">I, in thy light luxuriant robe, behold<span class="ws16">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Want and excess, abounding and yet cold:<span class="ws11">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Here needed, there display’d, in many a wanton fold;&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">Both health and beauty, learned authors show,</span>
<span class="i0">From a just medium in our clothing flow.”</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
<span class="i2">“Proceed, good doctor; if so great my need,</span>
<span class="i0">What is thy fee? Good doctor! pray proceed.”</span>
<span class="i2">“Large is my fee, fair lady, but I take</span>
<span class="i0">None till some progress in my cure I make.</span>
<span class="i0">Thou hast disease, fair maiden; thou art vain;</span>
<span class="i0">Within that face sit insult and disdain; <span class="linenum">390</span></span>
<span class="i0">Thou art enamour’d of thyself; my art</span>
<span class="i0">Can see the naughty malice of thy heart;</span>
<span class="i0">With a strong pleasure would thy bosom move,</span>
<span class="i0">Were I to own thy power, and ask thy love;</span>
<span class="i0">And such thy beauty, damsel, that I might,<span class="ws12">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">But for thy pride, feel danger in thy sight,<span class="ws13">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And lose my present peace in dreams of vain delight.” &emsp;}</span>
<span class="i2">“And can thy patients,” said the nymph, “endure</span>
<span class="i0">Physic like this? and will it work a cure?”</span>
<span class="i2">“Such is my hope, fair damsel; thou, I find, <span class="linenum">400</span></span>
<span class="i0">Hast the true tokens of a noble mind;</span>
<span class="i0">But the world wins thee, Sybil, and thy joys</span>
<span class="i0">Are placed in trifles, fashions, follies, toys;</span>
<span class="i0">Thou hast sought pleasure in the world around,</span>
<span class="i0">That in thine own pure bosom should be found.</span>
<span class="i0">Did all that world admire thee, praise and love,</span>
<span class="i0">Could it the least of nature’s pains remove?</span>
<span class="i0">Could it for errors, follies, sins atone,</span>
<span class="i0">Or give thee comfort, thoughtful and alone?</span>
<span class="i0">It has, believe me, maid, no power to charm <span class="linenum">410</span></span>
<span class="i0">Thy soul from sorrow, or thy flesh from harm:</span>
<span class="i0">Turn then, fair creature, from a world of sin,</span>
<span class="i0">And seek the jewel happiness within.”</span>
<span class="i2">“Speak’st thou at meeting?” said the nymph; “thy speech</span>
<span class="i0">Is that of mortal very prone to teach;</span>
<span class="i0">But wouldst thou, doctor, from the patient learn</span>
<span class="i0">Thine own disease?&mdash;The cure is thy concern.”</span>
<span class="i2">“Yea, with good will.”&mdash;“Then know, ’tis thy complaint,</span>
<span class="i0">That, for a sinner, thou’rt too much a saint;</span>
<span class="i0">Hast too much show of the sedate and pure, <span class="linenum">420</span></span>
<span class="i0">And without cause art formal and demure:</span>
<span class="i0">This makes a man unsocial, unpolite;</span>
<span class="i0">Odious when wrong, and insolent if right.</span>
<span class="i0">Thou may’st be good, but why should goodness be</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Wrapt in a garb of such formality?</span>
<span class="i0">Thy person well might please a damsel’s eye,</span>
<span class="i0">In decent habit with a scarlet dye;</span>
<span class="i0">But, jest apart&mdash;what virtue canst thou trace</span>
<span class="i0">In that broad brim that hides thy sober face?</span>
<span class="i0">Does that long-skirted drab, that over-nice <span class="linenum">430</span></span>
<span class="i0">And formal clothing, prove a scorn of vice?</span>
<span class="i0">Then for thine accent&mdash;what in sound can be</span>
<span class="i0">So void of grace as dull monotony?</span>
<span class="i0">Love has a thousand varied notes to move</span>
<span class="i0">The human heart&mdash;thou may’st not speak of love</span>
<span class="i0">Till thou hast cast thy formal ways aside,</span>
<span class="i0">And those becoming youth and nature tried;</span>
<span class="i0">Not till exterior freedom, spirit, ease,</span>
<span class="i0">Prove it thy study and delight to please;</span>
<span class="i0">Not till these follies meet thy just disdain, <span class="linenum">440</span></span>
<span class="i0">While yet thy virtues and thy worth remain.”</span>
<span class="i2">“This is severe!&mdash;Oh! maiden, wilt not thou</span>
<span class="i0">Something for habits, manners, modes, allow?”&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“Yes! but allowing much, I much require,</span>
<span class="i0">In my behalf, for manners, modes, attire!”</span>
<span class="i2">“True, lovely Sybil; and, this point agreed,</span>
<span class="i0">Let me to those of greater weight proceed:</span>
<span class="i0">Thy father”&mdash;“Nay,” she quickly interposed,</span>
<span class="i0">“Good doctor, here our conference is closed!”</span>
<span class="i2">Then left the youth, who, lost in his retreat, <span class="linenum">450</span></span>
<span class="i0">Pass’d the good matron on her garden-seat;</span>
<span class="i0">His looks were troubled, and his air, once mild</span>
<span class="i0">And calm, was hurried:&mdash;“My audacious child!”</span>
<span class="i0">Exclaim’d the dame, “I read what she has done</span>
<span class="i0">In thy displeasure&mdash;Ah! the thoughtless one;</span>
<span class="i0">But yet, Josiah, to my stern good man</span>
<span class="i0">Speak of the maid as mildly as you can.</span>
<span class="i0">Can you not seem to woo a little while</span>
<span class="i0">The daughter’s will, the father to beguile,</span>
<span class="i0">So that his wrath in time may wear away? <span class="linenum">460</span></span>
<span class="i0">Will you preserve our peace, Josiah? say!”</span>
<span class="i2">“Yes! my good neighbour,” said the gentle youth,</span>
<span class="i0">“Rely securely on my care and truth;</span>
<span class="i0">And, should thy comfort with my efforts cease,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And only then&mdash;perpetual is thy peace.”</span>
<span class="i2">The dame had doubts: she well his virtues knew,</span>
<span class="i0">His deeds were friendly, and his words were true;</span>
<span class="i0">“But to address this vixen is a task</span>
<span class="i0">He is ashamed to take, and I to ask.”</span>
<span class="i0">Soon as the father from Josiah learn’d <span class="linenum">470</span></span>
<span class="i0">What pass’d with Sybil, he the truth discern’d.</span>
<span class="i0">“He loves,” the man exclaim’d, “he loves, ’tis plain,</span>
<span class="i0">The thoughtless girl, and shall he love in vain?</span>
<span class="i0">She may be stubborn, but she shall be tried,</span>
<span class="i0">Born as she is of wilfulness and pride.”</span>
<span class="i2">With anger fraught, but willing to persuade,</span>
<span class="i0">The wrathful father met the smiling maid.</span>
<span class="i0">“Sybil,” said he, “I long, and yet I dread</span>
<span class="i0">To know thy conduct&mdash;hath Josiah fled,</span>
<span class="i0">And, grieved and fretted by thy scornful air, <span class="linenum">480</span></span>
<span class="i0">For his lost peace betaken him to prayer?</span>
<span class="i0">Couldst thou his pure and modest mind distress,<span class="ws3">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">By vile remarks upon his speech, address,<span class="ws8">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Attire, and voice?”&mdash;“All this I must confess.”&mdash;&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">“Unhappy child! what labour will it cost</span>
<span class="i0">To win him back!”&mdash;“I do not think him lost.”</span>
<span class="i0">“Courts he then, trifler, insult and disdain?”&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“No: but from these he courts me to refrain.”&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“Then hear me, Sybil: should Josiah leave</span>
<span class="i0">Thy father’s house?”&mdash;“My father’s child would grieve.”&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“That is of grace; and if he come again <span class="linenum">491</span></span>
<span class="i0">To speak of love?”&mdash;“I might from grief refrain.”&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“Then wilt thou, daughter, our design embrace?”&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“Can I resist it, if it be of grace?”&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“Dear child! in three plain words thy mind express&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Wilt thou have this good youth?”&mdash;“Dear father! yes.”</span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To farmer Moss, in Langar Vale, came down</span>
<span class="i0">His only daughter, from her school in town;</span>
<span class="i0">A tender, timid maid! who knew not how</span>
<span class="i0">To pass a pig-sty, or to face a cow:</span>
<span class="i0">Smiling she came, with petty talents graced,</span>
<span class="i0">A fair complexion, and a slender waist.</span>
<span class="i2">Used to spare meals, disposed in manner pure,</span>
<span class="i0">Her father’s kitchen she could ill endure;</span>
<span class="i0">Where by the steaming beef he hungry sat,</span>
<span class="i0">And laid at once a pound upon his plate; <span class="linenum">10</span></span>
<span class="i0">Hot from the field, her eager brother seized</span>
<span class="i0">An equal part, and hunger’s rage appeased;</span>
<span class="i0">The air, surcharged with moisture, flagg’d around,</span>
<span class="i0">And the offended damsel sigh’d and frown’d;</span>
<span class="i0">The swelling fat in lumps conglomerate laid,</span>
<span class="i0">And fancy’s sickness seized the loathing maid.</span>
<span class="i0">But, when the men beside their station took,</span>
<span class="i0">The maidens with them, and with these the cook;</span>
<span class="i0">When one huge wooden bowl before them stood,</span>
<span class="i0">Fill’d with huge balls of farinaceous food; <span class="linenum">20</span></span>
<span class="i0">With bacon, mass saline, where never lean</span>
<span class="i0">Beneath the brown and bristly rind was seen;</span>
<span class="i0">When from a single horn the party drew</span>
<span class="i0">Their copious draughts of heavy ale and new;</span>
<span class="i0">When the coarse cloth she saw, with many a stain,</span>
<span class="i0">Soil’d by rude hinds who cut and came again&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">She could not breathe; but, with a heavy sigh,</span>
<span class="i0">Rein’d the fair neck, and shut th’ offended eye;</span>
<span class="i0">She minced the sanguine flesh in frustums fine,</span>
<span class="i0">And wonder’d much to see the creatures dine: <span class="linenum">30</span></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
<span class="i0">When she resolved her father’s heart to move,</span>
<span class="i0">If hearts of farmers were alive to love.</span>
<span class="i2">She now entreated by herself to sit</span>
<span class="i0">In the small parlour, if papa thought fit,</span>
<span class="i0">And there to dine, to read, to work alone.&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“No!” said the farmer, in an angry tone;</span>
<span class="i0">“These are your school-taught airs; your mother’s pride</span>
<span class="i0">Would send you there; but I am now your guide.&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Arise betimes, our early meal prepare,</span>
<span class="i0">And, this despatch’d, let business be your care; <span class="linenum">40</span></span>
<span class="i0">Look to the lasses, let there not be one</span>
<span class="i0">Who lacks attention, till her tasks be done;</span>
<span class="i0">In every household work your portion take,</span>
<span class="i0">And what you make not, see that others make.</span>
<span class="i0">At leisure times attend the wheel, and see</span>
<span class="i0">The whit’ning web be sprinkled on the [lea];</span>
<span class="i0">When thus employ’d, should our young neighbour view</span>
<span class="i0">An useful lass, you may have more to do.”</span>
<span class="i2">Dreadful were these commands; but worse than these</span>
<span class="i0">The parting hint&mdash;a farmer could not please: <span class="linenum">50</span></span>
<span class="i0">’Tis true she had without abhorrence seen</span>
<span class="i0">Young Harry Carr, when he was smart and clean;</span>
<span class="i0">But to be married&mdash;be a farmer’s wife&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">A slave! a drudge!&mdash;she could not, for her life.</span>
<span class="i2">With swimming eyes the fretful nymph withdrew,</span>
<span class="i0">And, deeply sighing, to her chamber flew;</span>
<span class="i0">There on her knees, to Heav’n she grieving pray’d</span>
<span class="i0">For change of prospect to a tortured maid.</span>
<span class="i2">Harry, a youth whose late-departed sire</span>
<span class="i0">Had left him all industrious men require, <span class="linenum">60</span></span>
<span class="i0">Saw the pale beauty&mdash;and her shape and air</span>
<span class="i0">Engaged him much, and yet he must forbear:</span>
<span class="i0">“For my small farm what can the damsel do?”</span>
<span class="i0">He said&mdash;then stopp’d to take another view:</span>
<span class="i0">“Pity so sweet a lass will nothing learn</span>
<span class="i0">Of household cares&mdash;for what can beauty earn</span>
<span class="i0">By those small arts which they at school attain,</span>
<span class="i0">That keep them useless, and yet make them vain?”</span>
<span class="i2">This luckless damsel look’d the village round,</span>
<span class="i0">To find a friend, and one was quickly found; <span class="linenum">70</span></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
<span class="i0">A pensive widow&mdash;whose mild air and dress<span class="ws10">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Pleased the sad nymph, who wish’d her soul’s distress &emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">To one so seeming kind, confiding, to confess.&mdash; <span class="ws6">}</span></span>
<span class="i2">“What lady that?” the anxious lass inquired,</span>
<span class="i0">Who then beheld the one she most admired.</span>
<span class="i0">“Here,” said the brother, “are no ladies seen&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">That is a widow dwelling on the green;</span>
<span class="i0">A dainty dame, who can but barely live</span>
<span class="i0">On her poor pittance, yet contrives to give;</span>
<span class="i0">She happier days has known, but seems at ease, <span class="linenum">80</span></span>
<span class="i0">And you may call her lady, if you please.</span>
<span class="i0">But if you wish, good sister, to improve,</span>
<span class="i0">You shall see twenty better worth your love.”</span>
<span class="i2">These Nancy met; but, spite of all they taught,</span>
<span class="i0">This useless widow was the one she sought.</span>
<span class="i0">The father growl’d; but said he knew no harm</span>
<span class="i0">In such connexion that could give alarm;</span>
<span class="i0">“And if we thwart the trifler in her course,</span>
<span class="i0">’Tis odds against us she will take a worse.”</span>
<span class="i2">Then met the friends; the widow heard the sigh <span class="linenum">90</span></span>
<span class="i0">That ask’d at once compassion and reply:&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“Would you, my child, converse with one so poor,</span>
<span class="i0">Yours were the kindness&mdash;yonder is my door;</span>
<span class="i0">And, save the time that we in public pray,</span>
<span class="i0">From that poor cottage I but rarely stray.”</span>
<span class="i2">There went the nymph, and made her strong complaints,</span>
<span class="i0">Painting her wo as injured feeling paints.</span>
<span class="i2">“Oh, dearest friend! do think how one must feel,</span>
<span class="i0">Shock’d all day long, and sicken’d every meal;</span>
<span class="i0">Could you behold our kitchen (and to you <span class="linenum">100</span></span>
<span class="i0">A scene so shocking must indeed be new),</span>
<span class="i0">A mind like yours, with true refinement graced,</span>
<span class="i0">Would let no vulgar scenes pollute your taste;</span>
<span class="i0">And yet, in truth, from such a polish’d mind</span>
<span class="i0">All base ideas must resistance find,</span>
<span class="i0">And sordid pictures from the fancy pass,</span>
<span class="i0">As the breath startles from the polish’d glass.</span>
<span class="i2">“Here you enjoy a sweet romantic scene,</span>
<span class="i0">Without so pleasant, and within so clean;</span>
<span class="i0">These twining jess’mines, what delicious gloom <span class="linenum">110</span>
</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And soothing fragrance yield they to the room!</span>
<span class="i0">What lovely garden! there you oft retire,</span>
<span class="i0">And tales of wo and tenderness admire:</span>
<span class="i0">In that neat case, your books, in order placed,</span>
<span class="i0">Soothe the full soul, and charm the cultured taste;</span>
<span class="i0">And thus, while all about you wears a charm,</span>
<span class="i0">How must you scorn the farmer and the farm!”</span>
<span class="i2">The widow smiled, and “Know you not,” said she,&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">“How much these farmers scorn or pity me; <span class="ws9">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Who see what you admire, and laugh at all they see? &emsp;}<span class="linenum">120</span></span>
<span class="i0">True, their opinion alters not my fate,</span>
<span class="i0">By falsely judging of an humble state:</span>
<span class="i0">This garden, you with such delight behold,</span>
<span class="i0">Tempts not a feeble dame who dreads the cold;</span>
<span class="i0">These plants, which please so well your livelier sense,</span>
<span class="i0">To mine but little of their sweets dispense;</span>
<span class="i0">Books soon are painful to my failing sight,</span>
<span class="i0">And oftener read from duty than delight;</span>
<span class="i0">(Yet let me own, that I can sometimes find</span>
<span class="i0">Both joy and duty in the act combined;) <span class="linenum">130</span></span>
<span class="i0">But view me rightly, you will see no more</span>
<span class="i0">Than a poor female, willing to be poor;</span>
<span class="i0">Happy indeed, but not in books nor flowers,</span>
<span class="i0">Not in fair dreams, indulged in earlier hours,</span>

<span class="i2">“What words,” the lass replied, “offend my ear!</span>
<span class="i0">Try you my patience? Can you be sincere? <span class="linenum">160</span></span>
<span class="i0">And am I told a willing hand to give</span>

<span class="i0">Far other fate was yours&mdash;some gentle youth</span>
<span class="i0">Admired your beauty, and avow’d his truth;</span>
<span class="i0">The power of love prevail’d, and freely both</span>
<span class="i0">Gave the fond heart, and pledged the binding oath;</span>
<span class="i0">And then the rivals’ plot, the parent’s power,</span>

<span class="i0">Ah! let not memory lose the blissful view,</span>
<span class="i0">But fairly show what love has done for you.” <span class="linenum">170</span></span>
<span class="i2">“Agreed, my daughter; what my heart has known</span>
<span class="i0">Of love’s strange power shall be with frankness shown:</span>
<span class="i0">But let me warn you, that experience finds</span>
<span class="i0">Few of the scenes that lively hope designs.”&mdash;</span>
<span class="i2">“Mysterious all,” said Nancy; “you, I know,</span>
<span class="i0">Have suffer’d much; now deign the grief to show&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">I am your friend, and so prepare my heart</span>
<span class="i0">In all your sorrows to receive a part.”</span>
<span class="i2">The widow answer’d: “I had once, like you,</span>

<span class="i0">Hence, when the destined lovers meet, they prove</span>
<span class="i0">At once the force of this all-powerful love;</span>
<span class="i0">Each from that period feels the mutual smart, <span class="linenum">190</span></span>

<span class="i0">Nor is there peace till they delighted stand,</span>
<span class="i0">And, at the altar, hand is join’d to hand.</span>
<span class="i2">“Alas! my child, there are who, dreaming so,</span>
<span class="i0">Waste their fresh youth, and waking feel the wo;</span>
<span class="i0">There is no spirit sent the heart to move</span>

<span class="i0">Yet high and low, you see, forbear to mix;</span>
<span class="i0">No beggars’ eyes the heart of kings transfix;</span>

<span class="i0">For reason wakes, proud wishes to reprove;</span>
<span class="i0">You cannot hope, and therefore dare not love:</span>
<span class="i0">All would be safe, did we at first inquire&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">‘Does reason sanction what our hearts desire?’</span>
<span class="i0">But, quitting precept, let example show <span class="linenum">210</span></span>
<span class="i0">What joys from love uncheck’d by prudence flow.</span>
<span class="i2">“A youth my father in his office placed,</span>
<span class="i0">Of humble fortune, but with sense and taste;</span>
<span class="i0">But he was thin and pale, had downcast looks;</span>
<span class="i0">He studied much, and pored upon his books:</span>
<span class="i0">Confused he was when seen, and, when he saw</span>
<span class="i0">Me or my sisters, would in haste withdraw;</span>
<span class="i0">And had this youth departed with the year,</span>
<span class="i0">His loss had cost us neither sigh nor tear.</span>
<span class="i2">“But with my father still the youth remain’d, <span class="linenum">220</span></span>
<span class="i0">And more reward and kinder notice gain’d:</span>
<span class="i0">He often, reading, to the garden stray’d,</span>
<span class="i0">Where I by books or musing was delay’d;</span>
<span class="i0">This to discourse in summer evenings led,</span>
<span class="i0">Of these same evenings, or of what we read.</span>
<span class="i0">On such occasions we were much alone;</span>
<span class="i0">But, save the look, the manner, and the tone,</span>
<span class="i0">(These might have meaning,) all that we discuss’d</span>
<span class="i0">We could with pleasure to a parent trust.</span>
<span class="i2">“At length ’twas friendship&mdash;and my friend and I <span class="linenum">230</span></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Said we were happy, and began to sigh;</span>
<span class="i0">My sisters first, and then my father, found</span>
<span class="i0">That we were wandering o’er enchanted ground;</span>
<span class="i0">But he had troubles in his own affairs,</span>
<span class="i0">And would not bear addition to his cares.</span>
<span class="i0">With pity moved, yet angry, ‘Child,’ said he,</span>
<span class="i0">‘Will you embrace contempt and beggary?</span>
<span class="i0">Can you endure to see each other cursed</span>
<span class="i0">By want, of every human wo the worst?</span>
<span class="i0">Warring for ever with distress, in dread <span class="linenum">240</span></span>
<span class="i0">Either of begging or of wanting bread;</span>
<span class="i0">While poverty, with unrelenting force,</span>
<span class="i0">Will your own offspring from your love divorce;</span>
<span class="i0">They, through your folly, must be doom’d to pine,</span>
<span class="i0">And you deplore your passion, or resign;</span>
<span class="i0">For, if it die, what good will then remain?</span>
<span class="i0">And if it live, it doubles every pain.’”&mdash;</span>
<span class="i2">“But you were true,” exclaim’d the lass, “and fled <span class="ws10">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">The tyrant’s power who fill’d your soul with dread?”&mdash;<span class="ws8">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">“But,” said the smiling friend, “he fill’d my mouth with bread; &emsp;}<span class="linenum">250</span></span>
<span class="i0">And in what other place that bread to gain</span>
<span class="i0">We long consider’d, and we sought in vain.</span>
<span class="i0">This was my twentieth year&mdash;at thirty-five</span>
<span class="i0">Our hope was fainter, yet our love alive;</span>
<span class="i0">So many years in anxious doubt had pass’d.”&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“Then,” said the damsel, “you were bless’d at last?”</span>
<span class="i0">A smile again adorn’d the widow’s face,</span>
<span class="i0">But soon a starting tear usurp’d its place.&mdash;</span>
<span class="i2">“Slow pass’d the heavy years, and each had more</span>
<span class="i0">Pains and vexations than the years before. <span class="linenum">260</span></span>
<span class="i0">My father fail’d; his family was rent,</span>
<span class="i0">And to new states his grieving daughters sent;</span>
<span class="i0">Each to more thriving kindred found a way,</span>
<span class="i0">Guests without welcome&mdash;servants without pay;</span>
<span class="i0">Our parting hour was grievous; still I feel</span>
<span class="i0">The sad, sweet converse at our final meal:</span>
<span class="i0">Our father then reveal’d his former fears,</span>
<span class="i0">Cause of his sternness, and then join’d our tears;</span>
<span class="i0">Kindly he strove our feelings to repress,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But died, and left us heirs to his distress. <span class="linenum">270</span></span>
<span class="i0">The rich, as humble friends, my sisters chose;</span>
<span class="i0">I with a wealthy widow sought repose;</span>
<span class="i0">Who with a chilling frown her friend received,</span>
<span class="i0">Bade me rejoice, and wonder’d that I grieved:</span>
<span class="i0">In vain my anxious lover tried his skill</span>
<span class="i0">To rise in life, he was dependent still;</span>
<span class="i0">We met in grief, nor can I paint the fears</span>
<span class="i0">Of these unhappy, troubled, trying years:</span>
<span class="i0">Our dying hopes and stronger fears between,</span>
<span class="i0">We felt no season peaceful or serene; <span class="linenum">280</span></span>
<span class="i0">Our fleeting joys, like meteors in the night,</span>
<span class="i0">Shone on our gloom with inauspicious light;</span>
<span class="i0">And then domestic sorrows, till the mind,</span>
<span class="i0">Worn with distresses, to despair inclined;</span>
<span class="i0">Add too the ill that from the passion flows,</span>
<span class="i0">When its contemptuous frown the world bestows&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">The peevish spirit caused by long delay,</span>
<span class="i0">When being gloomy we contemn the gay,</span>
<span class="i0">When, being wretched, we incline to hate</span>
<span class="i0">And censure others in a happier state; <span class="linenum">290</span></span>
<span class="i0">Yet loving still, and still compell’d to move</span>
<span class="i0">In the sad labyrinth of ling’ring love:</span>
<span class="i0">While you, exempt from want, despair, alarm,</span>
<span class="i0">May wed&mdash;oh! take the farmer and the farm.”</span>
<span class="i2">“Nay,” said the nymph, “joy smiled on you at last!”</span>
<span class="i0">“Smiled for a moment,” she replied, “and pass’d:</span>
<span class="i0">My lover still the same dull means pursued,</span>
<span class="i0">Assistant call’d, but kept in servitude;</span>
<span class="i0">His spirits wearied in the prime of life,</span>
<span class="i0">By fears and wishes in eternal strife; <span class="linenum">300</span></span>
<span class="i0">At length he urged impatient&mdash;‘Now consent;</span>
<span class="i0">With thee united, fortune may relent.’</span>
<span class="i0">I paused, consenting; but a friend arose,</span>
<span class="i0">Pleased a fair view, though distant, to disclose;</span>
<span class="i0">From the rough ocean we beheld a gleam</span>
<span class="i0">Of joy, as transient as the joys we dream;</span>
<span class="i0">By lying hopes deceived, my friend retired,</span>
<span class="i0">And sail’d&mdash;was wounded&mdash;reach’d us&mdash;and expired!</span>
<span class="i0">You shall behold his grave, and, when I die,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
<span class="i0">There&mdash;but ’tis folly&mdash;I request to lie.” <span class="linenum">310</span></span>
<span class="i2">“Thus,” said the lass, “to joy you bade adieu!</span>
<span class="i0">But how a widow?&mdash;that cannot be true;</span>
<span class="i0">Or was it force, in some unhappy hour,</span>
<span class="i0">That placed you, grieving, in a tyrant’s power?”</span>
<span class="i2">“Force, my young friend, when forty years are fled,</span>
<span class="i0">Is what a woman seldom has to dread;</span>
<span class="i0">She needs no brazen locks nor guarding walls,</span>
<span class="i0">And seldom comes a lover, though she calls.</span>
<span class="i0">Yet moved by fancy, one approved my face,</span>
<span class="i0">Though time and tears had wrought it much disgrace. <span class="linenum">320</span></span>
<span class="i2">“The man I married was sedate and meek,</span>
<span class="i0">And spoke of love as men in earnest speak;</span>
<span class="i0">Poor as I was, he ceaseless sought, for years,</span>
<span class="i0">A heart in sorrow and a face in tears;</span>
<span class="i0">That heart I gave not; and ’twas long before</span>
<span class="i0">I gave attention, and then nothing more;</span>
<span class="i0">But in my breast some grateful feeling rose</span>
<span class="i0">For one whose love so sad a subject chose;</span>
<span class="i0">Till long delaying, fearing to repent,</span>
<span class="i0">But grateful still, I gave a cold assent. <span class="linenum">330</span></span>
<span class="i2">“Thus we were wed; no fault had I to find,</span>
<span class="i0">And he but one; my heart could not be kind:</span>
<span class="i0">Alas! of every early hope bereft,</span>
<span class="i0">There was no fondness in my bosom left;</span>
<span class="i0">So had I told him, but had told in vain,</span>
<span class="i0">He lived but to indulge me and complain.</span>
<span class="i0">His was this cottage, he inclosed this ground,</span>
<span class="i0">And planted all these blooming shrubs around;</span>
<span class="i0">He to my room these curious trifles brought,</span>
<span class="i0">And with assiduous love my pleasure sought; <span class="linenum">340</span></span>
<span class="i0">He lived to please me, and I oft-times strove</span>
<span class="i0">Smiling, to thank his unrequited love;</span>
<span class="i0">‘Teach me,’ he cried, ‘that pensive mind to ease,</span>
<span class="i0">For all my pleasure is the hope to please.’</span>
<span class="i2">“Serene, though heavy, were the days we spent,</span>
<span class="i0">Yet kind each word, and gen’rous each intent;</span>
<span class="i0">But his dejection lessen’d every day,</span>
<span class="i0">And to a placid kindness died away.</span>
<span class="i0">In tranquil ease we pass’d our latter years,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
<span class="i0">By griefs untroubl’d, unassail’d by fears. <span class="linenum">350</span></span>
<span class="i2">“Let not romantic views your bosom sway,</span>
<span class="i0">Yield to your duties, and their call obey:</span>
<span class="i0">Fly not a youth, frank, honest, and sincere;</span>
<span class="i0">Observe his merits, and his passion hear!</span>
<span class="i0">’Tis true, no hero, but a farmer sues&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Slow in his speech, but worthy in his views;</span>
<span class="i0">With him you cannot that affliction prove,</span>
<span class="i0">That rends the bosom of the poor in love;</span>
<span class="i0">Health, comfort, competence, and cheerful days,</span>
<span class="i0">Your friends’ approval, and your father’s praise, <span class="linenum">360</span></span>
<span class="i0">Will crown the deed, and you escape <i>their</i> fate</span>
<span class="i0">Who plan so wildly, and are wise too late.”</span>
<span class="i2">The damsel heard; at first th’ advice was strange,</span>
<span class="i0">Yet wrought a happy, nay, a speedy change.</span>
<span class="i0">“I have no care,” she said, when next they met,</span>
<span class="i0">“But one may wonder he is silent yet;</span>
<span class="i0">He looks around him with his usual stare,</span>
<span class="i0">And utters nothing&mdash;not that I shall care.”</span>
<span class="i2">This pettish humour pleased th’ experienced friend&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">None need despair, whose silence can offend; <span class="linenum">370</span></span>
<span class="i0">“Should I,” resumed the thoughtful lass, “consent</span>
<span class="i0">To hear the man, the man may now repent.</span>
<span class="i0">Think you my sighs shall call him from the plough,</span>
<span class="i0">Or give one hint, that ‘You may woo me now?’”</span>
<span class="i2">“Persist, my love,” replied the friend, “and gain</span>
<span class="i0">A parent’s praise, <i>that</i> cannot be in vain.”</span>
<span class="i2">The father saw the change, but not the cause,</span>
<span class="i0">And gave the alter’d maid his fond applause.</span>
<span class="i0">The coarser manners she in part removed,</span>
<span class="i0">In part endured, improving and improved; <span class="linenum">380</span></span>
<span class="i0">She spoke of household works, she rose betimes,</span>
<span class="i0">And said neglect and indolence were crimes;</span>
<span class="i0">The various duties of their life she weigh’d,</span>
<span class="i0">And strict attention to her dairy paid;</span>
<span class="i0">The names of servants now familiar grew,</span>
<span class="i0">And fair Lucinda’s from her mind withdrew.</span>
<span class="i0">As prudent travellers for their ease assume</span>
<span class="i0"><i>Their</i> modes and language to whose lands they come:</span>
<span class="i0">So to the farmer this fair lass inclined,</span>

<span class="i0">Gave to the business of the farm her mind; <span class="linenum">390</span></span>
<span class="i0">To useful arts she turn’d her hand and eye;</span>
<span class="i0">And by her manners told him&mdash;“You may try.”</span>
<span class="i2">Th’ observing lover more attention paid,</span>
<span class="i0">With growing pleasure, to the alter’d maid;</span>
<span class="i0">He fear’d to lose her, and began to see</span>
<span class="i0">That a slim beauty might a helpmate be;</span>
<span class="i0">’Twixt hope and fear he now the lass address’d,</span>
<span class="i0">And in his Sunday robe his love express’d.</span>
<span class="i0">She felt no chilling dread, no thrilling joy,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor was too quickly kind, too slowly coy; <span class="linenum">400</span></span>
<span class="i0">But still she lent an unreluctant ear</span>
<span class="i0">To all the rural business of the year;</span>
<span class="i0">Till love’s strong hopes endured no more delay,</span>
<span class="i0">And Harry ask’d, and Nancy named the day.</span>
<span class="i2">“A happy change! my boy,” the father cried:</span>
<span class="i0">“How lost your sister all her school-day pride?”</span>
<span class="i0">The youth replied, “It is the widow’s deed:</span>
<span class="i0">The cure is perfect, and was wrought with speed.”&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“And comes there, boy, this benefit of books,</span>
<span class="i0">Of that smart dress, and of those dainty looks? <span class="linenum">410</span></span>
<span class="i0">We must be kind&mdash;some offerings from the farm</span>
<span class="i0">To the white cot will speak our feelings warm;</span>
<span class="i0">Will show that people, when they know the fact,</span>
<span class="i0">Where they have judged severely, can retract.</span>
<span class="i0">Oft have I smil’d, when I beheld her pass</span>
<span class="i0">With cautious step, as if she hurt the grass;</span>
<span class="i0">Where if a snail’s retreat she chanced to storm,</span>
<span class="i0">She look’d as begging pardon of the worm;</span>
<span class="i0">And what, said I, still laughing at the view,</span>
<span class="i0">Have these weak creatures in the world to do? <span class="linenum">420</span></span>
<span class="i0">But some are made for action, some to speak;<span class="ws9">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And, while she looks so pitiful and meek,<span class="ws12">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Her words are weighty, though her nerves are weak.” &emsp;}</span>
<span class="i2">Soon told the village-bells the rite was done,</span>
<span class="i0">That join’d the school-bred miss and farmer’s son;</span>
<span class="i0">Her former habits some slight scandal raised,</span>
<span class="i0">But real worth was soon perceived and praised;</span>
<span class="i0">She, her neat taste imparted to the farm,</span>
<span class="i0">And he, th’ improving skill and vigorous arm.</span>

<span class="i0">Heiress to duties that she ill supplied:</span>

<span class="i0">And, when desired to speak, she sigh’d to find</span>

<span class="i0">Nor can you offer a reluctant hand;</span>
<span class="i0">His birth is noble, and his seat is grand.”</span>
<span class="i2">Alarm’d was Lucy, was in tears&mdash;“A fool!</span>

<span class="i0">Doubts any mortal, if a change of state</span>
<span class="i0">Dissolves all claims and ties of earlier date?”</span>
<span class="i2">The rector doubted, for he came to mourn</span>
<span class="i0">A sister dead, and with a wife return.</span>
<span class="i0">Lucy with heart unchanged received the youth,</span>
<span class="i0">True in herself, confiding in his truth;</span>
<span class="i0">But own’d her mother’s change: the haughty dame</span>

<span class="i0">The lover begg’d, insisted, urged his pain;</span>
<span class="i0">His brother wrote to threaten and complain;</span>
<span class="i0">Her sister, reasoning, proved the promise made,</span>

<span class="i0">But coldly answer’d in her wonted way,</span>
<span class="i0">That she “would rule, and Lucy must obey.”</span>
<span class="i2">With peevish fear, she saw her health decline,</span>
<span class="i0">And cried, “Oh! monstrous, for a man to pine; <span class="linenum">220</span></span>
<span class="i0">But if your foolish heart must yield to love,</span>
<span class="i0">Let him possess it whom I now approve;</span>
<span class="i0">This is my pleasure.”&mdash;Still the rector came</span>
<span class="i0">With larger offers and with bolder claim;</span>
<span class="i0">But the stern lady would attend no more&mdash;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
<span class="i0">She frown’d, and rudely pointed to the door;</span>

<span class="i2">Lucy, meantime, though threaten’d and distress’d,</span>
<span class="i0">Against her marriage made a strong protest.</span>
<span class="i0">All was domestic war: the aunt rebell’d</span>
<span class="i0">Against the sovereign will, and was expell’d;</span>
<span class="i0">And every power was tried and every art,</span>
<span class="i0">To bend to falsehood one determined heart;</span>
<span class="i0">Assail’d, in patience it received the shock,</span>
<span class="i0">Soft as the wave, unshaken as the rock;</span>
<span class="i0">But while th’ unconquer’d soul endures the storm</span>
<span class="i0">Of angry fate, it preys upon the form. <span class="linenum">240</span></span>
<span class="i0">With conscious virtue she resisted still,</span>
<span class="i0">And conscious love gave vigour to her will;</span>
<span class="i0">But Lucy’s trial was at hand; with joy</span>
<span class="i0">The mother cried&mdash;“Behold your constant boy&mdash;</span>

<span class="i0">The constant mind all outward force defied,<span class="ws10">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">By vengeance vainly urged, in vain assail’d by pride. &emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">Fix’d in her purpose, perfect in her part, <span class="linenum">260</span></span>
<span class="i0">She felt the courage of a wounded heart;</span>
<span class="i0">The world receded from her rising view,</span>
<span class="i0">When Heaven approach’d as earthly things withdrew;</span>
<span class="i0">Not strange before, for in the days of love,</span>

<span class="i0">Had the young priest a faithful lover died,</span>

<span class="i0">Forced the unpleasant thought, or thinking pray’d.</span>
<span class="i2">Surprised, the mother saw the languid frame,</span>

<span class="i0">Once with a frown she cried, “And do you mean</span>
<span class="i0">To die of love&mdash;the folly of fifteen?”</span>
<span class="i0">But as her anger met with no reply,</span>
<span class="i0">She let the gentle girl in quiet die;</span>

<span class="i2">“I am an humble actor, doom’d to play</span>

<span class="i0">To this idea all her soul she gave,</span>

<span class="i0">But reason dwelt where fancy stray’d before,</span>
<span class="i0">And the mind wander’d from its views no more;</span>
<span class="i0">Till death approach’d, when every look express’d</span>
<span class="i0">A sense of bliss, till every sense had rest. <span class="linenum">340</span></span>
<span class="i2">The mother lives, and has enough to buy</span>
<span class="i0">Th’ attentive ear and the submissive eye</span>
<span class="i0">Of abject natures&mdash;these are daily told,</span>
<span class="i0">How triumph’d beauty in the days of old;</span>
<span class="i0">How, by her window seated, crowds have cast</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Admiring glances, wondering as they pass’d;</span>
<span class="i0">How from her carriage as she stepp’d to pray,</span>
<span class="i0">Divided ranks would humbly make her way;</span>
<span class="i0">And how each voice in the astonish’d throng</span>
<span class="i0">Pronounced her peerless as she moved along. <span class="linenum">350</span></span>
<span class="i2">Her picture then the greedy dame displays;</span>
<span class="i0">Touch’d by no shame, she now demands its praise;</span>
<span class="i0">In her tall mirror then she shows a face,</span>
<span class="i0">Still coldly fair with unaffecting grace;</span>
<span class="i0">These she compares: “It has the form,” she cries,</span>
<span class="i0">“But wants the air, the spirit, and the eyes;</span>
<span class="i0">This, as a likeness, is correct and true,</span>
<span class="i0">But there alone the living grace we view.”</span>
<span class="i0">This said, th’ applauding voice the dame required,</span>
<span class="i0">And, gazing, slowly from the glass retired. <span class="linenum">360</span></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Of a fair town, where Doctor Rack was guide,</span>
<span class="i0">His only daughter was the boast and pride;</span>
<span class="i0">Wise Arabella&mdash;yet not wise alone,</span>
<span class="i0">She like a bright and polish’d brilliant shone;</span>
<span class="i0">Her father own’d her for his prop and stay,</span>
<span class="i0">Able to guide, yet willing to obey;</span>
<span class="i0">Pleased with her learning while discourse could please,</span>
<span class="i0">And with her love in languor and disease.</span>
<span class="i0">To every mother were her virtues known,</span>
<span class="i0">And to their daughters as a pattern shown; <span class="linenum">10</span></span>
<span class="i0">Who in her youth had all that age requires,</span>
<span class="i0">And, with her prudence, all that youth admires.</span>
<span class="i0">These odious praises made the damsels try</span>
<span class="i0">Not to obtain such merits, but deny;</span>
<span class="i0">For, whatsoever wise mammas might say,</span>
<span class="i0">To guide a daughter this was not the way;</span>
<span class="i0">From such applause disdain and anger rise,</span>
<span class="i0">And envy lives where emulation dies.</span>
<span class="i0">In all his strength contends the noble horse</span>
<span class="i0">With one who just precedes him on the course; <span class="linenum">20</span></span>
<span class="i0">But when the rival flies too far before,</span>
<span class="i0">His spirit fails, and he attempts no more.</span>
<span class="i2">This reasoning maid, above her sex’s dread,</span>
<span class="i0">Had dared to read, and dared to say she read;</span>
<span class="i0">Not the last novel, not the new-born play;</span>
<span class="i0">Not the mere trash and scandal of the day;</span>
<span class="i0">But (though her young companions felt the shock)</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
<span class="i0">She studied Berkeley, Bacon, Hobbes, and Locke:</span>
<span class="i0">Her mind within the maze of history dwelt,</span>
<span class="i0">And of the moral muse the beauty felt; <span class="linenum">30</span></span>
<span class="i0">The merits of the Roman page she knew,</span>
<span class="i0">And could converse with Moore and Montagu:</span>
<span class="i0">Thus she became the wonder of the town,</span>
<span class="i0">From that she reap’d, to that she gave, renown;</span>
<span class="i0">And strangers, coming, all were taught t’ admire</span>
<span class="i0">The learned lady, and the lofty spire.</span>
<span class="i2">Thus fame in public fix’d the maid, where all</span>
<span class="i0">Might throw their darts, and see the idol fall;</span>
<span class="i0">A hundred arrows came with vengeance keen,</span>
<span class="i0">From tongues envenom’d, and from arms unseen; <span class="linenum">40</span></span>
<span class="i0">A thousand eyes were fix’d upon the place,</span>
<span class="i0">That, if she fell, she might not fly disgrace.</span>
<span class="i0">But malice vainly throws the poison’d dart,</span>
<span class="i0">Unless our frailty shows the peccant part;</span>
<span class="i0">And Arabella still preserved her name</span>
<span class="i0">Untouch’d, and shone with undisputed fame;</span>
<span class="i0">Her very notice some respect would cause,</span>
<span class="i0">And her esteem was honour and applause.</span>
<span class="i2">Men she avoided&mdash;not in childish fear,</span>
<span class="i0">As if she thought some savage foe was near; <span class="linenum">50</span></span>
<span class="i0">Not as a prude, who hides that man should seek,</span>
<span class="i0">Or who by silence hints that they should speak;</span>
<span class="i0">But with discretion all the sex she view’d,</span>
<span class="i0">Ere yet engaged, pursuing, or pursued;</span>
<span class="i0">Ere love had made her to his vices blind,</span>
<span class="i0">Or hid the favourite’s failings from her mind.</span>
<span class="i2">Thus was the picture of the man portray’d,</span>
<span class="i0">By merit destined for so rare a maid;</span>
<span class="i0">At whose request she might exchange her state,</span>
<span class="i0">Or still be happy in a virgin’s fate. <span class="linenum">60</span></span>
<span class="i2">He must be one with manners like her own,</span>
<span class="i0">His life unquestion’d, his opinions known;</span>
<span class="i0">His stainless virtue must all tests endure,</span>
<span class="i0">His honour spotless, and his bosom pure;</span>
<span class="i0">She no allowance made for sex or times,</span>
<span class="i0">Of lax opinion&mdash;crimes were ever crimes;</span>
<span class="i0">No wretch forsaken must his frailty curse,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
<span class="i0">No spurious offspring drain his private purse:</span>
<span class="i0">He at all times his passions must command,</span>
<span class="i0">And yet possess&mdash;or be refused her hand. <span class="linenum">70</span></span>
<span class="i2">All this without reserve the maiden told,</span>
<span class="i0">And some began to weigh the rector’s gold;</span>
<span class="i0">To ask what sum a prudent man might gain,</span>
<span class="i0">Who had such store of virtues to maintain?</span>
<span class="i2">A Doctor Campbell, north of Tweed, came forth,</span>
<span class="i0">Declared his passion, and proclaim’d his worth;</span>
<span class="i0">Not unapproved, for he had much to say</span>
<span class="i0">On every cause, and in a pleasant way;</span>
<span class="i0">Not all his trust was in a pliant tongue,</span>
<span class="i0">His form was good, and ruddy he, and young. <span class="linenum">80</span></span>
<span class="i0">But, though the Doctor was a man of parts,</span>
<span class="i0">He read not deeply male or female hearts;</span>
<span class="i0">But judged that all whom he esteem’d as wise</span>
<span class="i0">Must think alike, though some assumed disguise;</span>
<span class="i0">That every reasoning Bramin, Christian, Jew,</span>
<span class="i0">Of all religions took their liberal view;</span>
<span class="i0">And of her own, no doubt, this learned maid</span>
<span class="i0">Denied the substance, and the forms obey’d;</span>
<span class="i0">And thus persuaded, he his thoughts express’d</span>
<span class="i0">Of her opinions, and his own profess’d: <span class="linenum">90</span></span>
<span class="i0">“All states demand this aid, the vulgar need</span>
<span class="i0">Their priests and pray’rs, their sermons and their creed;</span>
<span class="i0">And those of stronger minds should never speak</span>
<span class="i0">(In his opinion) what might hurt the weak.</span>
<span class="i0">A man may smile, but still he should attend <span class="ws15">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">His hour at church, and be the church’s friend,<span class="ws13">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">What there he thinks conceal, and what he hears commend.”&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i2">Frank was the speech, but heard with high disdain,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor had the Doctor leave to speak again;</span>
<span class="i0">A man who own’d, nay gloried in deceit, <span class="linenum">100</span></span>
<span class="i0">“He might despise her, but he should not cheat.”</span>
<span class="i2">Then Vicar Holmes appear’d; he heard it said</span>
<span class="i0">That ancient men best pleased the prudent maid;</span>
<span class="i0">And true it was her ancient friends she loved;</span>
<span class="i0">Servants when old she favour’d and approved;</span>
<span class="i0">Age in her pious parents she revered,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And neighbours were by length of days endear’d;</span>
<span class="i0">But, if her husband too must ancient be,</span>
<span class="i0">The good old Vicar found it was not he.</span>
<span class="i2">On Captain Bligh her mind in balance hung&mdash; <span class="linenum">110</span></span>
<span class="i0">Though valiant, modest; and reserved, though young:</span>
<span class="i0">Against these merits must defects be set&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Though poor, imprudent; and though proud, in debt:</span>
<span class="i0">In vain the Captain close attention paid;</span>
<span class="i0">She found him wanting, whom she fairly weigh’d.</span>
<span class="i2">Then came a youth, and all their friends agreed,</span>
<span class="i0">That Edward Huntly was the man indeed;</span>
<span class="i0">Respectful duty he had paid awhile,</span>
<span class="i0">Then ask’d her hand, and had a gracious smile:</span>
<span class="i0">A lover now declared, he led the fair <span class="linenum">120</span></span>
<span class="i0">To woods and fields, to visits and to pray’r;</span>
<span class="i0">Then whisper’d softly&mdash;“Will you name the day?”</span>
<span class="i0">She softly whisper’d&mdash;“If you love me, stay.”&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“Oh! try me not beyond my strength,” he cried;&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“Oh! be not weak,” the prudent maid replied;</span>
<span class="i0">“But by some trial your affection prove&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Respect and not impatience argues love;</span>
<span class="i0">And love no more is by impatience known,</span>
<span class="i0">Than Ocean’s depth is by its tempests shown.</span>
<span class="i0">He whom a weak and fond impatience sways,<span class="ws6">}</span><span class="linenum">130</span></span>
<span class="i0">But for himself with all his fervour prays, <span class="ws9">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And not the maid he woos, but his own will obeys;&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">And will she love the being who prefers,</span>
<span class="i0">With so much ardour, his desire to hers?”</span>
<span class="i2">Young Edward grieved, but let not grief be seen;</span>
<span class="i0">He knew obedience pleased his fancy’s queen:</span>
<span class="i0">Awhile he waited, and then cried&mdash;“Behold!</span>
<span class="i0">The year advancing, be no longer cold!”</span>
<span class="i0">For she had promised&mdash;“Let the flowers appear,</span>
<span class="i0">And I will pass with thee the smiling year.” <span class="linenum">140</span></span>
<span class="i0">Then pressing grew the youth; the more he press’d,</span>
<span class="i0">The less inclined the maid to his request:</span>
<span class="i0">“Let June arrive.”&mdash;Alas! when April came,</span>
<span class="i0">It brought a stranger, and the stranger, shame;</span>
<span class="i0">Nor could the lover from his house persuade</span>
<span class="i0">A stubborn lass whom he had mournful made;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Angry and weak, by thoughtless vengeance moved,</span>
<span class="i0">She told her story to the fair beloved;</span>
<span class="i0">In strongest words th’ unwelcome truth was shown,</span>
<span class="i0">To blight his prospects, careless of her own. <span class="linenum">150</span></span>
<span class="i2">Our heroine grieved, but had too firm a heart</span>
<span class="i0">For him to soften, when she swore to part;</span>
<span class="i0">In vain his seeming penitence and pray’r,</span>
<span class="i0">His vows, his tears: she left him in despair.</span>
<span class="i0">His mother fondly laid her grief aside,</span>
<span class="i0">And to the reason of the nymph applied&mdash;</span>
<span class="i2">“It well becomes thee, lady, to appear,</span>
<span class="i0">But not to be, in very truth, severe;</span>
<span class="i0">Although the crime be odious in thy sight,</span>
<span class="i0">That daring sex is taught such things to slight: <span class="linenum">160</span></span>
<span class="i0">His heart is thine, although it once was frail;</span>
<span class="i0">Think of his grief, and let his love prevail!&mdash;”</span>
<span class="i2">“Plead thou no more,” the lofty lass return’d;</span>
<span class="i0">“Forgiving woman is deceived and spurn’d.</span>
<span class="i0">Say that the crime is common&mdash;shall I take</span>
<span class="i0">A common man my wedded lord to make?</span>
<span class="i0">See! a weak woman by his arts betray’d,</span>
<span class="i0">An infant born his father to upbraid;</span>
<span class="i0">Shall I forgive his vileness, take his name,</span>
<span class="i0">Sanction his error, and partake his shame? <span class="linenum">170</span></span>
<span class="i0">No! this assent would kindred frailty prove,</span>
<span class="i0">A love for him would be a vicious love:</span>
<span class="i0">Can a chaste maiden secret counsel hold</span>
<span class="i0">With one whose crime by every mouth is told?</span>
<span class="i0">Forbid it spirit, prudence, virtuous pride;</span>
<span class="i0">He must despise me, were he not denied.</span>
<span class="i0">The way from vice the erring mind to win<span class="ws12">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Is with presuming sinners to begin, <span class="ws17">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And show, by scorning them, a just contempt for sin.”&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i2">The youth, repulsed, to one more mild convey’d <span class="linenum">180</span></span>
<span class="i0">His heart, and smiled on the remorseless maid;</span>
<span class="i0">The maid, remorseless in her pride, the while</span>
<span class="i0">Despised the insult, and return’d the smile.</span>
<span class="i2">First to admire, to praise her, and defend,</span>
<span class="i0">Was (now in years advanced) a virgin friend:</span>
<span class="i0">Much she preferr’d, she cried, a single state,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
<span class="i0">“It was her choice”&mdash;it surely was her fate;</span>
<span class="i0">And much it pleased her in the train to view</span>
<span class="i0">A maiden vot’ress, wise and lovely too.</span>
<span class="i2">Time to the yielding mind his change imparts, <span class="linenum">190</span></span>
<span class="i0">He varies notions, and he alters hearts;</span>
<span class="i0">’Tis right, ’tis just to feel contempt for vice,</span>
<span class="i0">But he that shows it may be over-nice:</span>
<span class="i0">There are who feel, when young, the false sublime,</span>
<span class="i0">And proudly love to show disdain for crime;</span>
<span class="i0">To whom the future will new thoughts supply,</span>
<span class="i0">The pride will soften, and the scorn will die;</span>
<span class="i0">Nay, where they still the vice itself condemn,</span>
<span class="i0">They bear the vicious, and consort with them.</span>
<span class="i0">Young Captain Grove, when one had changed his side, <span class="linenum">200</span></span>
<span class="i0">Despised the venal turn-coat, and defied;</span>
<span class="i0">Old Colonel Grove now shakes him by the hand,</span>
<span class="i0">Though he who bribes may still his vote command.</span>
<span class="i0">Why would not Ellen to Belinda speak,</span>
<span class="i0">When she had flown to London for a week,</span>
<span class="i0">And then return’d, to every friend’s surprise,</span>
<span class="i0">With twice the spirit, and with half the size?</span>
<span class="i0">She spoke not then&mdash;but, after years had flown,</span>
<span class="i0">A better friend had Ellen never known:</span>
<span class="i0">Was it the lady her mistake had seen? <span class="linenum">210</span></span>
<span class="i0">Or had she also such a journey been?</span>
<span class="i0">No: ’twas the gradual change in human hearts,</span>
<span class="i0">That time, in commerce with the world, imparts;</span>
<span class="i0">That on the roughest temper throws disguise,</span>
<span class="i0">And steals from virtue her asperities.</span>
<span class="i0">The young and ardent, who with glowing zeal</span>
<span class="i0">Felt wrath for trifles, and were proud to feel,</span>
<span class="i0">Now find those trifles all the mind engage,</span>
<span class="i0">To soothe dull hours, and cheat the cares of age;</span>
<span class="i0">As young Zelinda, in her quaker-dress, <span class="linenum">220</span></span>
<span class="i0">Disdain’d each varying fashion’s vile excess,</span>
<span class="i0">And now her friends on old Zelinda gaze,</span>
<span class="i0">Pleased in rich silks and orient gems to blaze.</span>
<span class="i0">Changes like these ’tis folly to condemn,</span>
<span class="i0">So virtue yields not, nor is changed with them.</span>
<span class="i2">Let us proceed:&mdash;Twelve brilliant years were past,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Yet each with less of glory than the last;</span>
<span class="i0">Whether these years to this fair virgin gave</span>
<span class="i0">A softer mind&mdash;effect they often have;</span>
<span class="i0">Whether the virgin-state was not so bless’d <span class="linenum">230</span></span>
<span class="i0">As that good maiden in her zeal profess’d;</span>
<span class="i0">Or whether lovers falling from her train,</span>
<span class="i0">Gave greater price to those she could retain,</span>
<span class="i0">Is all unknown;&mdash;but Arabella now</span>
<span class="i0">Was kindly listening to a merchant’s vow;</span>
<span class="i0">Who offer’d terms so fair, against his love</span>
<span class="i0">To strive was folly; so she never strove.&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Man in his earlier days we often find</span>
<span class="i0">With a too easy and unguarded mind;</span>
<span class="i0">But, by increasing years and prudence taught, <span class="linenum">240</span></span>
<span class="i0">He grows reserved, and locks up every thought.</span>
<span class="i0">Not thus the maiden, for in blooming youth</span>
<span class="i0">She hides her thought, and guards the tender truth;</span>
<span class="i0">This, when no longer young, no more she hides,</span>
<span class="i0">But frankly in the favour’d swain confides.</span>
<span class="i0">Man, stubborn man, is like the growing tree,</span>
<span class="i0">That longer standing, still will harder be;</span>
<span class="i0">And like its fruit the virgin, first austere,</span>
<span class="i0">Then kindly softening with the ripening year.</span>
<span class="i2">Now was the lover urgent, and the kind <span class="linenum">250</span></span>
<span class="i0">And yielding lady to his suit inclined:</span>
<span class="i0">“A little time, my friend, is just, is right;</span>
<span class="i0">We must be decent in our neighbours’ sight:”</span>
<span class="i0">Still she allow’d him of his hopes to speak,</span>
<span class="i0">And in compassion took off week by week;</span>
<span class="i0">Till few remain’d, when, wearied with delay,</span>
<span class="i0">She kindly meant to take off day by day.</span>
<span class="i2">That female friend who gave our virgin praise</span>
<span class="i0">For flying man and all his treacherous ways,</span>
<span class="i0">Now heard with mingled anger, shame and fear, <span class="linenum">260</span></span>
<span class="i0">Of one accepted, and a wedding near;</span>
<span class="i0">But she resolved again with friendly zeal</span>
<span class="i0">To make the maid her scorn of wedlock feel;</span>
<span class="i0">For she was grieved to find her work undone,</span>
<span class="i0">And like a sister mourn’d the failing nun.</span>
<span class="i2">Why are these gentle maidens prone to make</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Their sister-doves the tempting world forsake?</span>
<span class="i0">Why all their triumph when a maid disdains</span>
<span class="i0">The tyrant-sex, and scorns to wear its chains?</span>
<span class="i0">Is it pure joy to see a sister flown <span class="linenum">270</span></span>
<span class="i0">From the false pleasures they themselves have known?</span>
<span class="i0">Or do they, as the call-birds in the cage,</span>
<span class="i0">Try, in pure envy, others to engage;</span>
<span class="i0">And therefore paint their native woods and groves,</span>
<span class="i0">As scenes of dangerous joys and naughty loves?</span>
<span class="i2">Strong was the maiden’s hope; her friend was proud,</span>
<span class="i0">And had her notions to the world avow’d;</span>
<span class="i0">And, could she find the Merchant weak and frail,</span>
<span class="i0">With power to prove it, then she must prevail;</span>
<span class="i0">For she aloud would publish his disgrace, <span class="linenum">280</span></span>
<span class="i0">And save his victim from a man so base.</span>
<span class="i2">When all inquiries had been duly made,</span>
<span class="i0">Came the kind friend her burthen to unlade:&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“Alas! my dear! not all our care and art</span>
<span class="i0">Can tread the maze of man’s deceitful heart:</span>
<span class="i0">Look not surprise&mdash;nor let resentment swell</span>
<span class="i0">Those lovely features, all will yet be well;</span>
<span class="i0">And thou, from love’s and man’s deceptions free,</span>
<span class="i0">Wilt dwell in virgin-state, and walk to heav’n with me.”</span>
<span class="i2">The maiden frown’d, and then conceived “that wives <span class="linenum">290</span></span>
<span class="i0">Could walk as well, and lead as holy lives</span>
<span class="i0">As angry prudes who scorn’d the marriage-chain,</span>
<span class="i0">Or luckless maids who sought it still in vain.”</span>
<span class="i2">The friend was vex’d&mdash;she paused, at length she cried:</span>
<span class="i0">“Know your own danger, then your lot decide;</span>
<span class="i0">That traitor Beswell, while he seeks your hand,</span>
<span class="i0">Has, I affirm, a wanton at command;</span>
<span class="i0">A slave, a creature from a foreign place,</span>
<span class="i0">The nurse and mother of a spurious race;</span>
<span class="i0">Brown, ugly bastards&mdash;(Heaven the word forgive, <span class="linenum">300</span></span>
<span class="i0">And the deed punish!)&mdash;in his cottage live;</span>
<span class="i0">To town if business calls him, there he stays</span>
<span class="i0">In sinful pleasures wasting countless days;</span>
<span class="i0">Nor doubt the facts, for I can witness call</span>
<span class="i0">For every crime, and prove them one and all.”</span>
<span class="i2">Here ceased th’ informer; Arabella’s look</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Was like a school-boy’s puzzled by his book;</span>
<span class="i0">Intent she cast her eyes upon the floor,</span>
<span class="i0">Paused&mdash;then replied&mdash;</span>
<span class="i22">“I wish to know no more:</span>
<span class="i0">I question not your motive, zeal, or love, <span class="linenum">310</span></span>
<span class="i0">But must decline such dubious points to prove.&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">All is not true, I judge, for who can guess</span>
<span class="i0">Those deeds of darkness men with care suppress?</span>
<span class="i0">He brought a slave perhaps to England’s coast,</span>
<span class="i0">And made her free; it is our country’s boast!</span>
<span class="i0">And she perchance too grateful&mdash;good and ill</span>
<span class="i0">Were sown at first, and grow together still;</span>
<span class="i0">The colour’d infants on the village-green,</span>
<span class="i0">What are they more than we have often seen?</span>
<span class="i0">Children half-clothed who round their village stray,&emsp;}<span class="linenum">320</span></span>

<span class="i0">Let us in Christian love for all account,</span>
<span class="i0">And then behold to what such tales amount.”</span>
<span class="i2">“His heart is evil,” said th’ impatient friend&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“My duty bids me try that heart to mend,”</span>
<span class="i0">Replied the virgin&mdash;“We may be too nice,</span>
<span class="i0">And lose a soul in our contempt of vice;</span>

<span class="i0">And what for virtue can I better do</span>
<span class="i0">Than to reclaim him, if the charge be true?”</span>
<span class="i2">She spoke, nor more her holy work delay’d;</span>
<span class="i0">’Twas time to lend an erring mortal aid:</span>
<span class="i0">“The noblest way,” she judged, “a soul to win,<span class="ws8">}</span></span>

<span class="i0">It is the soul that sees; the outward eyes<span class="ws13">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Present the object, but the mind descries;<span class="ws12">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And thence delight, disgust, or cool indiff’rence rise: &emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">When minds are joyful, then we look around,</span>
<span class="i0">And what is seen is all on fairy ground;</span>
<span class="i0">Again they sicken, and on every view</span>
<span class="i0">Cast their own dull and melancholy hue;</span>
<span class="i0">Or, if absorb’d by their peculiar cares,</span>
<span class="i0">The vacant eye on viewless matter glares,</span>
<span class="i0">Our feelings still upon our views attend, <span class="linenum">10</span></span>
<span class="i0">And their own natures to the objects lend;</span>
<span class="i0">Sorrow and joy are in their influence sure,</span>
<span class="i0">Long as the passion reigns th’ effects endure;</span>
<span class="i0">But love in minds his various changes makes,</span>
<span class="i0">And clothes each object with the change he takes;</span>
<span class="i0">His light and shade on every view he throws,</span>
<span class="i0">And on each object, what he feels, bestows.</span>
<span class="i2">Fair was the morning, and the month was June,</span>
<span class="i0">When rose a lover; love awakens soon;</span>
<span class="i0">Brief his repose, yet much he dreamt the while <span class="linenum">20</span></span>
<span class="i0">Of that day’s meeting, and his Laura’s smile;</span>
<span class="i0">Fancy and love that name assign’d to her,</span>
<span class="i0">Call’d Susan in the parish-register;</span>
<span class="i0">And he no more was John&mdash;his Laura gave</span>
<span class="i0">The name Orlando to her faithful slave.</span>
<span class="i2">Bright shone the glory of the rising day,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
<span class="i0">When the fond traveller took his favourite way;</span>
<span class="i0">He mounted gaily, felt his bosom light,</span>
<span class="i0">And all he saw was pleasing in his sight.</span>
<span class="i2">“Ye hours of expectation, quickly fly, <span class="linenum">30</span></span>
<span class="i0">And bring on hours of blest reality;</span>
<span class="i0">When I shall Laura see, beside her stand,</span>
<span class="i0">Hear her sweet voice, and press her yielded hand.”</span>
<span class="i2">First o’er a barren heath beside the coast</span>
<span class="i0">Orlando rode, and joy began to boast.</span>
<span class="i2">“This neat low gorse,” said he, “with golden bloom,</span>
<span class="i0">Delights each sense, is beauty, is perfume;</span>
<span class="i0">And this gay ling, with all its purple flowers,</span>
<span class="i0">A man at leisure might admire for hours;</span>
<span class="i0">This green-fringed cup-moss has a scarlet tip, <span class="linenum">40</span></span>
<span class="i0">That yields to nothing but my Laura’s lip;</span>
<span class="i0">And then how fine this herbage! men may say</span>
<span class="i0">A heath is barren; nothing is so gay:</span>
<span class="i0">Barren or bare to call such charming scene</span>
<span class="i0">Argues a mind possess’d by care and spleen.”</span>
<span class="i2">Onward he went, and fiercer grew the heat,</span>
<span class="i0">Dust rose in clouds before the horse’s feet;</span>
<span class="i0">For now he pass’d through lanes of burning sand,</span>
<span class="i0">Bounds to thin crops or yet uncultured land;</span>
<span class="i0">Where the dark poppy flourished on the dry <span class="linenum">50</span></span>
<span class="i0">And sterile soil, and mock’d the thin-set rye.</span>
<span class="i2">“How lovely this!” the rapt Orlando said;</span>
<span class="i0">“With what delight is labouring man repaid!</span>
<span class="i0">The very lane has sweets that all admire,</span>
<span class="i0">The rambling suckling and the vigorous brier;</span>
<span class="i0">See! wholesome wormwood grows beside the way,</span>
<span class="i0">Where dew-press’d yet the dog-rose bends the spray;</span>
<span class="i0">Fresh herbs the fields, fair shrubs the banks adorn,</span>
<span class="i0">And snow-white bloom falls flaky from the thorn;</span>
<span class="i0">No fostering hand they need, no sheltering wall; <span class="linenum">60</span></span>
<span class="i0">They spring uncultured and they bloom for all.”</span>
<span class="i2">The lover rode as hasty lovers ride,</span>
<span class="i0">And reach’d a common pasture wild and wide;</span>
<span class="i0">Small black-legg’d sheep devour with hunger keen</span>
<span class="i0">The meagre herbage, fleshless, lank, and lean;</span>
<span class="i0">Such o’er thy level turf, Newmarket! stray,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And there, with other <i>black-legs</i> find their prey.</span>
<span class="i0">He saw some scatter’d hovels; turf was piled</span>
<span class="i0">In square brown stacks; a prospect bleak and wild!</span>
<span class="i0">A mill, indeed, was in the centre found, <span class="linenum">70</span></span>
<span class="i0">With short sear herbage withering all around;</span>
<span class="i0">A smith’s black shed opposed a wright’s long shop,</span>
<span class="i0">And join’d an inn where humble travellers stop.</span>
<span class="i2">“Ay, this is Nature,” said the gentle ’squire;</span>
<span class="i0">“This ease, peace, pleasure&mdash;who would not admire?</span>
<span class="i0">With what delight these sturdy children play,</span>
<span class="i0">And joyful rustics at the close of day;</span>
<span class="i0">Sport follows labour, on this even space</span>
<span class="i0">Will soon commence the wrestling and the race;</span>
<span class="i0">Then will the village-maidens leave their home, <span class="linenum">80</span></span>
<span class="i0">And to the dance with buoyant spirits come;</span>
<span class="i0">No affectation in their looks is seen,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor know they what disguise or flattery mean;</span>
<span class="i0">Nor aught to move an envious pang they see&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Easy their service, and their love is free;</span>
<span class="i0">Hence early springs that love, it long endures,</span>
<span class="i0">And life’s first comfort, while they live, ensures.</span>
<span class="i0">They the low roof and rustic comforts prize,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor cast on prouder mansions envying eyes;</span>
<span class="i0">Sometimes the news at yonder town they hear, <span class="linenum">90</span></span>
<span class="i0">And learn what busier mortals feel and fear;</span>
<span class="i0">Secure themselves, although by tales amazed</span>
<span class="i0">Of towns bombarded and of cities razed;</span>
<span class="i0">As if they doubted, in their still retreat,</span>
<span class="i0">The very news that makes their quiet sweet,</span>
<span class="i0">And their days happy&mdash;happier only knows</span>
<span class="i0">He on whom Laura her regard bestows.”</span>
<span class="i2">On rode Orlando, counting all the while</span>
<span class="i0">The miles he pass’d and every coming mile;</span>
<span class="i0">Like all attracted things, he quicker flies, <span class="linenum">100</span></span>
<span class="i0">The place approaching where th’ attraction lies;</span>
<span class="i0">When next appear’d a <i>dam</i>&mdash;so call the place&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Where lies a road confined in narrow space;</span>
<span class="i0">A work of labour, for on either side<span class="ws15">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Is level fen, a prospect wild and wide,<span class="ws13">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">With dikes on either hand by ocean’s self supplied. &emsp;}</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Far on the right the distant sea is seen,</span>
<span class="i0">And salt the springs that feed the marsh between;</span>
<span class="i0">Beneath an ancient bridge, the straiten’d flood</span>
<span class="i0">Rolls through its sloping banks of slimy mud; <span class="linenum">110</span></span>
<span class="i0">Near it a sunken boat resists the tide,</span>
<span class="i0">That frets and hurries to th’ opposing side;</span>
<span class="i0">The rushes sharp, that on the borders grow,<span class="ws6">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Bend their brown flow’rets to the stream below,&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">Impure in all its course, in all its progress slow: &emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">Here a grave Flora<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
                 scarcely deigns to bloom,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor wears a rosy blush, nor sheds perfume;</span>
<span class="i0">The few dull flowers that o’er the place are spread</span>
<span class="i0">Partake the nature of their fenny bed;</span>
<span class="i0">Here on its wiry stem, in rigid bloom, <span class="linenum">120</span></span>
<span class="i0">Grows the salt lavender that lacks perfume;</span>
<span class="i0">Here the dwarf sallows creep, the septfoil harsh,</span>
<span class="i0">And the soft slimy mallow of the marsh;</span>
<span class="i0">Low on the ear the distant billows sound,</span>
<span class="i0">And just in view appears their stony bound;</span>
<span class="i0">No hedge nor tree conceals the glowing sun, <span class="ws7">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Birds, save a wat’ry tribe, the district shun, <span class="ws8">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Nor chirp among the reeds where bitter waters run.&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i2">“Various as beauteous, Nature, is thy face,”</span>
<span class="i0">Exclaim’d Orlando: “all that grows has grace; <span class="linenum">130</span></span>
<span class="i0">All are appropriate&mdash;bog, and marsh, and fen,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Are only poor to undiscerning men;</span>
<span class="i0">Here may the nice and curious eye explore</span>
<span class="i0">How Nature’s hand adorns the rushy moor;</span>
<span class="i0">Here the rare moss in secret shade is found,</span>
<span class="i0">Here the sweet myrtle of the shaking ground;</span>
<span class="i0">Beauties are these that from the view retire,</span>
<span class="i0">But well repay th’ attention they require;</span>
<span class="i0">For these my Laura will her home forsake,</span>
<span class="i0">And all the pleasures they afford partake.” <span class="linenum">140</span></span>
<span class="i2">Again the country was enclosed, a wide</span>
<span class="i0">And sandy road has banks on either side;</span>
<span class="i0">Where, lo! a hollow on the left appear’d,</span>
<span class="i0">And there a gipsy-tribe their tent had rear’d;</span>
<span class="i0">’Twas open spread, to catch the morning sun,</span>
<span class="i0">And they had now their early meal begun,</span>
<span class="i0">When two brown boys just left their grassy seat,</span>
<span class="i0">The early trav’ller with their pray’rs to greet.</span>
<span class="i0">While yet Orlando held his pence in hand,</span>
<span class="i0">He saw their sister on her duty stand; <span class="linenum">150</span></span>
<span class="i0">Some twelve years old, demure, affected, sly,</span>
<span class="i0">Prepared the force of early powers to try;</span>
<span class="i0">Sudden a look of languor he descries,</span>
<span class="i0">And well-feign’d apprehension in her eyes;</span>
<span class="i0">Train’d but yet savage, in her speaking face</span>
<span class="i0">He mark’d the features of her vagrant race;</span>
<span class="i0">When a light laugh and roguish leer express’d</span>
<span class="i0">The vice implanted in her youthful breast.</span>
<span class="i0">Forth from the tent her elder brother came,</span>
<span class="i0">Who seem’d offended, yet forbore to blame <span class="linenum">160</span></span>
<span class="i0">The young designer, but could only trace</span>
<span class="i0">The looks of pity in the trav’ller’s face;</span>
<span class="i0">Within, the father, who from fences nigh <span class="ws12">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Had brought the fuel for the fire’s supply, <span class="ws11">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Watch’d now the feeble blaze, and stood dejected by;&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">On ragged rug, just borrow’d from the bed,</span>
<span class="i0">And by the hand of coarse indulgence fed,</span>
<span class="i0">In dirty patchwork negligently dress’d,</span>
<span class="i0">Reclined the wife, an infant at her breast;</span>
<span class="i0">In her wild face some touch of grace remain’d, <span class="linenum">170</span></span>
<span class="i0">Of vigour palsied and of beauty stain’d;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Her bloodshot eyes on her unheeding mate</span>
<span class="i0">Were wrathful turn’d, and seem’d her wants to state,</span>
<span class="i0">Cursing his tardy aid&mdash;her mother there</span>
<span class="i0">With gipsy-state engross’d the only chair;</span>
<span class="i0">Solemn and dull her look; with such she stands,</span>
<span class="i0">And reads the milk-maid’s fortune in her hands,</span>
<span class="i0">Tracing the lines of life; assumed through years,</span>
<span class="i0">Each feature now the steady falsehood wears;</span>
<span class="i0">With hard and savage eye she views the food, <span class="linenum">180</span></span>
<span class="i0">And, grudging, pinches their intruding brood;</span>
<span class="i0">Last in the group, the worn-out grandsire sits</span>
<span class="i0">Neglected, lost, and living but by fits;</span>
<span class="i0">Useless, despised, his worthless labours done,</span>
<span class="i0">And half protected by the vicious son,</span>
<span class="i0">Who half supports him; he with heavy glance</span>
<span class="i0">Views the young ruffians who around him dance;</span>
<span class="i0">And, by the sadness in his face, appears</span>
<span class="i0">To trace the progress of their future years:</span>
<span class="i0">Through what strange course of misery, vice, deceit, <span class="linenum">190</span></span>
<span class="i0">Must wildly wander each unpractised cheat!</span>
<span class="i0">What shame and grief, what punishment and pain,</span>
<span class="i0">Sport of fierce passions, must each child sustain&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Ere they like him approach their latter end,</span>
<span class="i0">Without a hope, a comfort, or a friend!</span>
<span class="i2">But this Orlando felt not; “Rogues,” said he,</span>
<span class="i0">“Doubtless they are, but merry rogues they be;</span>
<span class="i0">They wander round the land, and be it true,</span>
<span class="i0">They break the laws&mdash;then let the laws pursue</span>
<span class="i0">The wanton idlers; for the life they live, <span class="linenum">200</span></span>
<span class="i0">Acquit I cannot, but I can forgive.”</span>
<span class="i0">This said, a portion from his purse was thrown,</span>
<span class="i0">And every heart seem’d happy like his own.</span>
<span class="i2">He hurried forth, for now the town was nigh&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“The happiest man of mortal men am I.”</span>
<span class="i0">Thou art! but change in every state is near,</span>
<span class="i0">(So, while the wretched hope, the blest may fear);</span>
<span class="i0">“Say, where is Laura!”&mdash;“That her words must show,”</span>
<span class="i0">A lass replied; “read this, and thou shalt know!”</span>

<span class="i0">“But you can follow;”&mdash;“Yes;”&mdash;“The miles are few,</span>
<span class="i0">The way is pleasant; will you come?&mdash;Adieu!</span>
<span class="i0">Thy Laura!” “No! I feel I must resign</span>
<span class="i0">The pleasing hope; thou hadst been here, if mine.</span>
<span class="i0">A lady was it?&mdash;Was no brother there?</span>
<span class="i0">But why should I afflict me if there were?</span>
<span class="i0">‘The way is pleasant.’”&mdash;What to me the way?</span>
<span class="i0">I cannot reach her till the close of day.</span>
<span class="i0">My dumb companion! is it thus we speed? <span class="linenum">220</span></span>
<span class="i0">Not I from grief nor thou from toil art freed;</span>
<span class="i0">Still art thou doom’d to travel and to pine,</span>
<span class="i0">For my vexation&mdash;What a fate is mine!</span>
<span class="i2">“Gone to a friend, she tells me; I commend</span>
<span class="i0">Her purpose; means she to a female friend?</span>
<span class="i0">By Heaven, I wish she suffer’d half the pain</span>
<span class="i0">Of hope protracted through the day in vain:</span>
<span class="i0">Shall I persist to see th’ ungrateful maid?</span>
<span class="i0">Yes, I will see her, slight her, and upbraid.</span>
<span class="i0">What! in the very hour? She knew the time, <span class="linenum">230</span></span>
<span class="i0">And doubtless chose it to increase her crime.”</span>
<span class="i2">Forth rode Orlando by a river’s side, <span class="ws9">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Inland and winding, smooth, and full and wide,<span class="ws3">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">That roll’d majestic on, in one soft-flowing tide;&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">The bottom gravel, flow’ry were the banks,</span>
<span class="i0">Tall willows, waving in their broken ranks;</span>
<span class="i0">The road, now near, now distant, winding led</span>
<span class="i0">By lovely meadows which the waters fed;</span>
<span class="i0">He pass’d the way-side inn, the village spire,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor stopp’d to gaze, to question, or admire; <span class="linenum">240</span></span>
<span class="i0">On either side the rural mansions stood,<span class="ws16">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">With hedge-row trees, and hills high-crown’d with wood,&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">And many a devious stream that reach’d the nobler flood.&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i2">“I hate these scenes,” Orlando angry cried,</span>
<span class="i0">“And these proud farmers! yes, I hate their pride.</span>
<span class="i0">See! that sleek fellow, how he strides along,</span>

<span class="i0">For slaughter fatted, as a lady’s smile</span>
<span class="i0">Rejoices man, and means his death the while.</span>
<span class="i0">Lo! now the sons of labour! every day</span>
<span class="i0">Employ’d in toil, and vex’d in every way;</span>
<span class="i0">Theirs is but mirth assumed, and they conceal,</span>
<span class="i0">In their affected joys, the ills they feel:</span>
<span class="i0">I hate these long green lanes; there’s nothing seen <span class="linenum">260</span></span>
<span class="i0">In this vile country but eternal green;</span>
<span class="i0">Woods! waters! meadows! Will they never end?</span>
<span class="i0">’Tis a vile prospect.&mdash;Gone to see a friend!”&mdash;</span>
<span class="i2">Still on he rode! a mansion fair and tall</span>
<span class="i0">Rose on his view&mdash;the pride of Loddon-Hall:</span>
<span class="i0">Spread o’er the park he saw the grazing steer,</span>
<span class="i0">The full-fed steed, the herds of bounding deer;</span>
<span class="i0">On a clear stream the vivid sunbeams play’d, <span class="ws4">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Through noble elms, and on the surface made<span class="ws4">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">That moving picture, checker’d light and shade;&emsp;}<span class="linenum">270</span></span>
<span class="i0">Th’ attended children, there indulged to stray,</span>
<span class="i0">Enjoy’d and gave new beauty to the day;</span>
<span class="i0">Whose happy parents from their room were seen</span>
<span class="i0">Pleased with the sportive idlers on the green.</span>
<span class="i2">“Well!” said Orlando, “and for one so bless’d, <span class="ws5">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">A thousand reasoning wretches are distress’d;<span class="ws8">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, these so seeming glad, are grieving like the rest:&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">Man is a cheat&mdash;and all but strive to hide</span>
<span class="i0">Their inward misery by their outward pride.</span>
<span class="i0">What do yon lofty gates and walls contain, <span class="linenum">280</span></span>
<span class="i0">But fruitless means to soothe unconquer’d pain?</span>
<span class="i0">The parents read each infant daughter’s smile,</span>
<span class="i0">Form’d to seduce, encouraged to beguile;</span>
<span class="i0">They view the boys unconscious of their fate,</span>
<span class="i0">Sure to be tempted, sure to take the bait;</span>
<span class="i0">These will be Lauras, sad Orlandos these&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">There’s guilt and grief in all one hears and sees.”</span>
<span class="i2">Our trav’ller, lab’ring up a hill, look’d down</span>
<span class="i0">Upon a lively, busy, pleasant town;</span>
<span class="i0">All he beheld were there alert, alive, <span class="linenum">290</span></span>
<span class="i0">The busiest bees that ever stock’d a hive:</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
<span class="i0">A pair were married, and the bells aloud</span>
<span class="i0">Proclaim’d their joy, and joyful seem’d the crowd;</span>
<span class="i0">And now proceeding on his way, he spied,</span>
<span class="i0">Bound by strong ties, the bridegroom and the bride;</span>
<span class="i0">Each by some friends attended, near they drew,</span>
<span class="i0">And spleen beheld them with prophetic view.</span>
<span class="i2">“Married! nay, mad!” Orlando cried in scorn;</span>
<span class="i0">“Another wretch on this unlucky morn!</span>
<span class="i0">What are this foolish mirth, these idle joys? <span class="linenum">300</span></span>
<span class="i0">Attempts to stifle doubt and fear by noise:</span>
<span class="i0">To me these robes, expressive of delight,</span>
<span class="i0">Foreshow distress, and only grief excite;</span>
<span class="i0">And for these cheerful friends, will they behold</span>
<span class="i0">Their wailing brood in sickness, want, and cold;</span>
<span class="i0">And his proud look, and her soft languid air</span>
<span class="i0">Will&mdash;but I spare you&mdash;go, unhappy pair!”</span>
<span class="i2">And now approaching to the journey’s end, <span class="ws4">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">His anger fails, his thoughts to kindness tend,<span class="ws5">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">He less offended feels, and rather fears t’ offend:&emsp;}<span class="linenum">310</span></span>
<span class="i0">Now gently rising, hope contends with doubt,</span>
<span class="i0">And casts a sunshine on the views without;</span>
<span class="i0">And still reviving joy and lingering gloom</span>
<span class="i0">Alternate empire o’er his soul assume;</span>
<span class="i0">Till, long perplex’d, he now began to find</span>
<span class="i0">The softer thoughts engross the settling mind.</span>
<span class="i0">He saw the mansion, and should quickly see</span>
<span class="i0">His Laura’s self&mdash;and angry could he be?</span>
<span class="i0">No! the resentment melted all away&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“For this my grief a single smile will pay,” <span class="linenum">320</span></span>
<span class="i0">Our trav’ller cried;&mdash;“And why should it offend,</span>
<span class="i0">That one so good should have a pressing friend?</span>
<span class="i0">Grieve not, my heart! to find a favourite guest&emsp;&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">Thy pride and boast&mdash;ye selfish sorrows, rest;&emsp;&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">She will be kind, and I again be blest.”<span class="ws10">}</span></span>
<span class="i2">While gentler passions thus his bosom sway’d,</span>
<span class="i0">He reach’d the mansion, and he saw the maid;</span>
<span class="i0">“My Laura!”&mdash;“My Orlando!&mdash;this is kind;</span>
<span class="i0">In truth I came persuaded, not inclined.</span>
<span class="i0">Our friends’ amusement let us now pursue, <span class="linenum">330</span></span>
<span class="i0">And I to-morrow will return with you.”</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
<span class="i2">Like man entranced, the happy lover stood&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“As Laura wills, for she is kind and good;</span>
<span class="i0">Ever the truest, gentlest, fairest, best&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">As Laura wills, I see her and am blest.”</span>
<span class="i2">Home went the lovers through that busy place,</span>
<span class="i0">By Loddon-Hall, the country’s pride and grace;</span>
<span class="i0">By the rich meadows where the oxen fed,</span>
<span class="i0">Through the green vale that form’d the river’s bed;</span>
<span class="i0">And by unnumber’d cottages and farms, <span class="linenum">340</span></span>
<span class="i0">That have for musing minds unnumber’d charms,</span>
<span class="i0">And how affected by the view of these</span>
<span class="i0">Was then Orlando&mdash;did they pain or please?</span>
<span class="i2">Nor pain nor pleasure could they yield&mdash;and why?<span class="ws3">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">The mind was fill’d, was happy, and the eye<span class="ws10">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Roved o’er the fleeting views, that but appear’d to die.&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i2">Alone Orlando on the morrow paced</span>
<span class="i0">The well-known road; the [gipsy]-tent he traced;</span>
<span class="i0">The dam high-raised, the reedy dikes between,</span>
<span class="i0">The scatter’d hovels on the barren green, <span class="linenum">350</span></span>
<span class="i0">The burning sand, the fields of thin-set rye,</span>
<span class="i0">Mock’d by the useless Flora, blooming by;</span>
<span class="i0">And last the heath with all its various bloom,</span>
<span class="i0">And the close lanes that led the trav’ller home.</span>
<span class="i2">Then could these scenes the former joys renew?</span>
<span class="i0">Or was there now dejection in the view?&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Nor one or other would they yield&mdash;and why?<span class="ws10">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">The mind was absent, and the vacant eye<span class="ws14">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Wander’d o’er viewless scenes, that but appear’d to die.&emsp;}</span>

<span class="i2">Genius! thou gift of Heav’n! thou light divine!</span>
<span class="i0">Amid what dangers art thou doom’d to shine!</span>
<span class="i0">Oft will the body’s weakness check thy force,</span>
<span class="i0">Oft damp thy vigour, and impede thy course;</span>
<span class="i0">And trembling nerves compel thee to restrain</span>
<span class="i0">Thy nobler efforts, to contend with pain;</span>
<span class="i0">Or Want (sad guest!) will in thy presence come,</span>
<span class="i0">And breathe around her melancholy gloom;</span>
<span class="i0">To life’s low cares will thy proud thought confine,</span>
<span class="i0">And make her sufferings, her impatience, thine. <span class="linenum">10</span></span>
<span class="i2">Evil and strong, seducing passions prey</span>
<span class="i0">On soaring minds, and win them from their way;</span>
<span class="i0">Who then to vice the subject spirits give,</span>
<span class="i0">And in the service of the conqu’ror live;</span>
<span class="i0">Like captive Samson making sport for all,</span>
<span class="i0">Who fear’d their strength, and glory in their fall.</span>
<span class="i2">Genius, with virtue, still may lack the aid</span>
<span class="i0">Implored by humble minds and hearts afraid;</span>
<span class="i0">May leave to timid souls the shield and sword</span>
<span class="i0">Of the tried faith, and the resistless word; <span class="linenum">20</span></span>
<span class="i0">Amid a world of dangers venturing forth,</span>
<span class="i0">Frail, but yet fearless, proud in conscious worth,</span>
<span class="i0">Till strong temptation, in some fatal time,</span>
<span class="i0">Assails the heart, and wins the soul to crime;</span>
<span class="i0">When, left by honour, and by sorrow spent,</span>
<span class="i0">Unused to pray, unable to repent,</span>
<span class="i0">The nobler powers that once exalted high</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Th’ aspiring man, shall then degraded lie:</span>
<span class="i0">Reason, through anguish, shall her throne forsake,</span>
<span class="i0">And strength of mind but stronger madness make. <span class="linenum">30</span></span>
<span class="i2">When <span class="smcap">Edward Shore</span> had reach’d his twentieth year,</span>
<span class="i0">He felt his bosom light, his conscience clear;</span>
<span class="i0">Applause at school the youthful hero gain’d,</span>
<span class="i0">And trials there with manly strength sustain’d;</span>
<span class="i0">With prospects bright upon the world he came,</span>
<span class="i0">Pure love of virtue, strong desire of fame;</span>
<span class="i0">Men watch’d the way his lofty mind would take,</span>
<span class="i0">And all foretold the progress he would make.</span>
<span class="i2">Boast of these friends, to older men a guide,</span>
<span class="i0">Proud of his parts, but gracious in his pride; <span class="linenum">40</span></span>
<span class="i0">He bore a gay good-nature in his face,</span>
<span class="i0">And in his air were dignity and grace;</span>
<span class="i0">Dress that became his state and years he wore,</span>
<span class="i0">And sense and spirit shone in Edward Shore.</span>
<span class="i2">Thus while admiring friends the youth beheld,</span>
<span class="i0">His own disgust their forward hopes repell’d;</span>
<span class="i0">For he unfix’d, unfixing, look’d around,</span>
<span class="i0">And no employment but in seeking found;</span>
<span class="i0">He gave his restless thoughts to views refined,</span>
<span class="i0">And shrank from worldly cares with wounded mind. <span class="linenum">50</span></span>
<span class="i2">Rejecting trade, awhile he dwelt on laws,</span>
<span class="i0">“But who could plead, if unapproved the cause?”</span>
<span class="i0">A doubting, dismal tribe physicians seem’d;</span>
<span class="i0">Divines o’er texts and disputations dream’d;</span>
<span class="i0">War and its glory he perhaps could love,</span>
<span class="i0">But there again he must the cause approve.</span>
<span class="i2">Our hero thought no deed should gain applause,</span>
<span class="i0">Where timid virtue found support in laws;</span>
<span class="i0">He to all good would soar, would fly all sin,</span>
<span class="i0">By the pure prompting of the will within; <span class="linenum">60</span></span>
<span class="i0">“Who needs a law that binds him not to steal,”</span>
<span class="i0">Ask’d the young teacher, “can he rightly feel?</span>
<span class="i0">To curb the will, or arm in honour’s cause,</span>
<span class="i0">Or aid the weak&mdash;are these enforced by laws?</span>
<span class="i0">Should we a foul, ungenerous action dread,</span>
<span class="i0">Because a law condemns th’ adulterous bed?</span>
<span class="i0">Or fly pollution, not for fear of stain,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But that some statute tells us to refrain?</span>
<span class="i0">The grosser herd in ties like these we bind,</span>
<span class="i0">In virtue’s freedom moves th’ enlighten’d mind.” <span class="linenum">70</span></span>
<span class="i2">“Man’s heart deceives him,” said a friend. “Of course,”</span>
<span class="i0">Replied the youth, “but, has it power to force?</span>
<span class="i0">Unless it forces, call it as you will,</span>
<span class="i0">It is but wish, and proneness to the ill.”</span>
<span class="i2">“Art thou not tempted?” “Do I fall?” said Shore:</span>
<span class="i0">“The pure have fallen.”&mdash;“Then are pure no more.</span>
<span class="i0">While reason guides me, I shall walk aright,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor need a steadier hand, or stronger light;</span>
<span class="i0">Nor this in dread of awful threats, design’d</span>
<span class="i0">For the weak spirit and the grov’ling mind, <span class="linenum">80</span></span>
<span class="i0">But that, engaged by thoughts and views sublime,</span>
<span class="i0">I wage free war with grossness and with crime.”</span>
<span class="i0">Thus look’d he proudly on the vulgar crew,</span>
<span class="i0">Whom statutes govern, and whom fears subdue.</span>
<span class="i2">Faith, with his virtue, he indeed profess’d,</span>
<span class="i0">But doubts deprived his ardent mind of rest;</span>
<span class="i0">Reason, his sovereign mistress, fail’d to show</span>
<span class="i0">Light through the mazes of the world below;</span>
<span class="i0">Questions arose, and they surpass’d the skill</span>
<span class="i0">Of his sole aid, and would be dubious still; <span class="linenum">90</span></span>
<span class="i0">These to discuss he sought no common guide,</span>
<span class="i0">But to the doubters in his doubts applied;</span>
<span class="i0">When all together might in freedom speak,</span>
<span class="i0">And their loved truth with mutual ardour seek.</span>
<span class="i0">Alas! though men who feel their eyes decay</span>
<span class="i0">Take more than common pains to find their way,</span>
<span class="i0">Yet, when for this they ask each other’s aid,</span>
<span class="i0">Their mutual purpose is the more delay’d:</span>
<span class="i0">Of all their doubts, their reasoning clear’d not one,</span>
<span class="i0">Still the same spots were present in the sun; <span class="linenum">100</span></span>
<span class="i0">Still the same scruples haunted Edward’s mind,</span>
<span class="i0">Who found no rest, nor took the means to find.</span>
<span class="i2">But though with shaken faith, and slave to fame,</span>
<span class="i0">Vain and aspiring on the world he came;</span>
<span class="i0">Yet was he studious, serious, moral, grave,</span>
<span class="i0">No passion’s victim, and no system’s slave;</span>
<span class="i0">Vice he opposed, indulgence he disdain’d,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And o’er each sense in conscious triumph reign’d.</span>
<span class="i2">Who often reads, will sometimes wish to write,</span>
<span class="i0">And Shore would yield instruction and delight: <span class="linenum">110</span></span>
<span class="i0">A serious drama he design’d, but found</span>
<span class="i0">’Twas tedious travelling in that gloomy ground;</span>
<span class="i0">A deep and solemn story he would try,</span>
<span class="i0">But grew ashamed of ghosts, and laid it by;</span>
<span class="i0">Sermons he wrote, but they who knew his creed,</span>
<span class="i0">Or knew it not, were ill disposed to read;</span>
<span class="i0">And he would lastly be the nation’s guide,</span>
<span class="i0">But, studying, fail’d to fix upon a side;</span>
<span class="i0">Fame he desired, and talents he possess’d,</span>
<span class="i0">But loved not labour, though he could not rest, <span class="linenum">120</span></span>
<span class="i0">Nor firmly fix the vacillating mind,</span>
<span class="i0">That, ever working, could no centre find.</span>
<span class="i2">’Tis thus a sanguine reader loves to trace</span>
<span class="i0">The Nile forth rushing on his glorious race;</span>
<span class="i0">Calm and secure the fancied traveller goes</span>
<span class="i0">Through sterile deserts and by threat’ning foes;</span>
<span class="i0">He thinks not then of Afric’s scorching sands,</span>
<span class="i0">Th’ Arabian sea, the Abyssinian bands;</span>
<span class="i0">Fasils<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
                 and Michaels, and the robbers all,</span>

<span class="i0">He of success alone delights to think,<span class="ws13">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">He views that fount, he stands upon the brink,<span class="ws6">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And drinks a fancied draught, exulting so to drink. &emsp;}</span>
<span class="i2">In his own room, and with his books around,</span>
<span class="i0">His lively mind its chief employment found;</span>
<span class="i0">Then idly busy, quietly employ’d,</span>
<span class="i0">And, lost to life, his visions were enjoy’d;</span>
<span class="i0">Yet still he took a keen inquiring view</span>
<span class="i0">Of all that crowds neglect, desire, pursue;</span>
<span class="i0">And thus abstracted, curious, still, serene, <span class="linenum">140</span></span>
<span class="i0">He, unemploy’d, beheld life’s shifting scene;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Still more averse from vulgar joys and cares,</span>
<span class="i0">Still more unfitted for the world’s affairs.</span>
<span class="i2">There was a house where Edward oft-times went,</span>
<span class="i0">And social hours in pleasant trifling spent;</span>
<span class="i0">He read, conversed and reason’d, sang and play’d,</span>
<span class="i0">And all were happy while the idler stay’d;</span>
<span class="i0">Too happy one, for thence arose the pain,</span>
<span class="i0">Till this engaging trifler came again.</span>
<span class="i2">But did he love? We answer, day by day, <span class="linenum">150</span></span>
<span class="i0">The loving feet would take th’ accustom’d way;</span>
<span class="i0">The amorous eye would rove as if in quest</span>
<span class="i0">Of something rare, and on the mansion rest;</span>
<span class="i0">The same soft passion touch’d the gentle tongue,</span>
<span class="i0">And Anna’s charms in tender notes were sung;</span>
<span class="i0">The ear too seem’d to feel the common flame,</span>
<span class="i0">Sooth’d and delighted with the fair one’s name;</span>
<span class="i0">And thus as love each other part possess’d,</span>
<span class="i0">The heart, no doubt, its sovereign power confess’d.</span>
<span class="i2">Pleased in her sight, the youth required no more; <span class="linenum">160</span></span>
<span class="i0">Not rich himself, he saw the damsel poor;</span>
<span class="i0">And he too wisely, nay, too kindly loved,</span>
<span class="i0">To pain the being whom his soul approved.</span>
<span class="i2">A serious friend our cautious youth possess’d,</span>
<span class="i0">And at his table sat a welcome guest;</span>
<span class="i0">Both unemploy’d, it was their chief delight</span>
<span class="i0">To read what free and daring authors write;</span>
<span class="i0">Authors who loved from common views to soar,</span>
<span class="i0">And seek the fountains never traced before;</span>
<span class="i0">Truth they profess’d, yet often left the true <span class="linenum">170</span></span>
<span class="i0">And beaten prospect, for the wild and new.</span>
<span class="i0">His chosen friend his fiftieth year had seen,</span>
<span class="i0">His fortune easy, and his air serene;</span>
<span class="i0">Deist and atheist call’d; for few agreed</span>
<span class="i0">What were his notions, principles, or creed;</span>
<span class="i0">His mind reposed not, for he hated rest,</span>
<span class="i0">But all things made a query or a jest;</span>
<span class="i0">Perplex’d himself, he ever sought to prove</span>
<span class="i0">That man is doom’d in endless doubt to rove;</span>
<span class="i0">Himself in darkness he profess’d to be, <span class="linenum">180</span></span>
<span class="i0">And would maintain that not a man could see.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
<span class="i2">The youthful friend, dissentient, reason’d still</span>
<span class="i0">Of the soul’s prowess, and the subject will;</span>
<span class="i0">Of virtue’s beauty, and of honour’s force,</span>
<span class="i0">And a warm zeal gave life to his discourse;</span>
<span class="i0">Since from his feelings all his fire arose,</span>
<span class="i0">And he had interest in the themes he chose.</span>
<span class="i2">The friend, indulging a sarcastic smile,</span>
<span class="i0">Said&mdash;“Dear enthusiast! thou wilt change thy style,</span>

<span class="i2">Yet lo! this cautious man, so coolly wise,</span>
<span class="i0">On a young beauty fix’d unguarded eyes;</span>
<span class="i0">And her he married. Edward at the view</span>
<span class="i0">Bade to his cheerful visits long adieu;</span>
<span class="i0">But haply err’d, for this engaging bride</span>
<span class="i0">No mirth suppress’d, but rather cause supplied;</span>
<span class="i0">And, when she saw the friends, by reasoning long,</span>
<span class="i0">Confused if right, and positive if wrong,</span>
<span class="i0">With playful speech and smile, that spoke delight, <span class="linenum">200</span></span>
<span class="i0">She made them careless both of wrong and right.</span>
<span class="i2">This gentle damsel gave consent to wed,</span>
<span class="i0">With school and school-day dinners in her head:</span>
<span class="i0">She now was promised choice of daintiest food,</span>
<span class="i0">And costly dress, that made her sovereign good;</span>
<span class="i0">With walks on hilly heath to banish spleen,</span>
<span class="i0">And summer-visits when the roads were clean.</span>
<span class="i0">All these she loved, to these she gave consent,</span>
<span class="i0">And she was married to her heart’s content.</span>
<span class="i2">Their manner this&mdash;the friends together read, <span class="linenum">210</span></span>
<span class="i0">Till books a cause for disputation bred;</span>
<span class="i0">Debate then follow’d, and the vapour’d child</span>
<span class="i0">Declared they argued till her head was wild;</span>
<span class="i0">And strange to her it was that mortal brain</span>
<span class="i0">Could seek the trial, or endure the pain.</span>
<span class="i2">Then, as the friend reposed, the younger pair</span>
<span class="i0">Sat down to cards, and play’d beside his chair;</span>
<span class="i0">Till he, awaking, to his books applied,</span>
<span class="i0">Or heard the music of th’ obedient bride.</span>
<span class="i0">If mild the evening, in the fields they stray’d, <span class="linenum">220</span></span>
<span class="i0">And their own flock with partial eye survey’d;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But oft the husband, to indulgence prone,</span>
<span class="i0">Resumed his book, and bade them walk alone.</span>
<span class="i2">“Do, my kind Edward! I must take mine ease,</span>
<span class="i0">Name the dear girl the planets and the trees;</span>
<span class="i0">Tell her what warblers pour their evening song,</span>
<span class="i0">What insects flutter, as you walk along;</span>
<span class="i0">Teach her to fix the roving thoughts, to bind</span>
<span class="i0">The wandering sense, and methodize the mind.”</span>
<span class="i2">This was obey’d; and oft when this was done, <span class="linenum">230</span></span>
<span class="i0">They calmly gazed on the declining sun;</span>
<span class="i0">In silence saw the glowing landscape fade,</span>
<span class="i0">Or, sitting, sang beneath the arbour’s shade:</span>
<span class="i0">Till rose the moon, and on each youthful face</span>
<span class="i0">Shed a soft beauty, and a dangerous grace.</span>
<span class="i2">When the young wife beheld in long debate</span>
<span class="i0">The friends, all careless as she seeming sate;</span>
<span class="i0">It soon appear’d, there was in one combined</span>
<span class="i0">The nobler person and the richer mind:</span>
<span class="i0">He wore no wig, no grisly beard was seen, <span class="linenum">240</span></span>
<span class="i0">And none beheld him careless or unclean;</span>
<span class="i0">Or watch’d him sleeping&mdash;we indeed have heard</span>
<span class="i0">Of sleeping beauty, and it has appear’d;</span>
<span class="i0">’Tis seen in infants; there indeed we find</span>
<span class="i0">The features soften’d by the slumbering mind&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">But other beauties, when disposed to sleep,</span>
<span class="i0">Should from the eye of keen inspector keep:</span>
<span class="i0">The lovely nymph who would her swain surprise,</span>
<span class="i0">May close her mouth, but not conceal her eyes;</span>
<span class="i0">Sleep from the fairest face some beauty takes, <span class="linenum">250</span></span>
<span class="i0">And all the homely features homelier makes;</span>
<span class="i0">So thought our wife, beholding with a sigh</span>
<span class="i0">Her sleeping spouse, and Edward smiling by.</span>
<span class="i2">A sick relation for the husband sent;</span>
<span class="i0">Without delay the friendly sceptic went;</span>
<span class="i0">Nor fear’d the youthful pair, for he had seen</span>
<span class="i0">The wife untroubled, and the friend serene;</span>
<span class="i0">No selfish purpose in his roving eyes,</span>
<span class="i0">No vile deception in her fond replies:</span>
<span class="i0">So judged the husband, and with judgment true, <span class="linenum">260</span></span>
<span class="i0">For neither yet the guilt or danger knew.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
<span class="i2">What now remain’d? but they again should play</span>
<span class="i0">Th’ accustom’d game, and walk th’ accustom’d way;</span>
<span class="i0">With careless freedom should converse or read,</span>
<span class="i0">And the friend’s absence neither fear nor heed.</span>
<span class="i0">But rather now they seem’d confused, constrain’d;&nbsp;<span class="ws5">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Within their room still restless they remain’d,&nbsp;<span class="ws9">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And painfully they felt, and knew each other pain’d.&mdash;&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">Ah! foolish men! how could ye thus depend,</span>
<span class="i0">One on himself, the other on his friend? <span class="linenum">270</span></span>
<span class="i2">The youth with troubled eye the lady saw,</span>
<span class="i0">Yet felt too brave, too daring to withdraw;</span>
<span class="i0">While she, with tuneless hand the jarring keys</span>
<span class="i0">Touching, was not one moment at her ease.</span>
<span class="i0">Now would she walk, and call her friendly guide,</span>
<span class="i0">Now speak of rain, and cast her cloak aside;</span>
<span class="i0">Seize on a book, unconscious what she read,</span>
<span class="i0">And restless still, to new resources fled;</span>
<span class="i0">Then laugh’d aloud, then tried to look serene,</span>
<span class="i0">And ever changed, and every change was seen. <span class="linenum">280</span></span>
<span class="i2">Painful it is to dwell on deeds of shame&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">The trying day was past, another came;</span>
<span class="i0">The third was all remorse, confusion, dread,</span>
<span class="i0">And (all too late!) the fallen hero fled.</span>
<span class="i2">Then felt the youth, in that seducing time,</span>
<span class="i0">How feebly honour guards the heart from crime:</span>
<span class="i0">Small is his native strength; man needs the stay,</span>
<span class="i0">The strength imparted in the trying day;</span>
<span class="i0">For all that honour brings against the force</span>
<span class="i0">Of headlong passion, aids its rapid course; <span class="linenum">290</span></span>
<span class="i0">Its slight resistance but provokes the fire,</span>
<span class="i0">As wood-work stops the flame, and then conveys it higher.</span>
<span class="i2">The husband came; a wife by guilt made bold</span>
<span class="i0">Had, meeting, sooth’d him, as in days of old;</span>
<span class="i0">But soon this fact transpired; her strong distress,</span>
<span class="i0">And his friend’s absence, left him nought to guess.</span>
<span class="i2">Still cool, though grieved, thus prudence bade him write&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“I cannot pardon, and I will not fight;</span>
<span class="i0">Thou art too poor a culprit for the laws,</span>
<span class="i0">And I too faulty to support my cause. <span class="linenum">300</span></span>
<span class="i0">All must be punish’d; I must sigh alone,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
<span class="i0">At home thy victim for her guilt atone;</span>
<span class="i0">And thou, unhappy! virtuous now no more,</span>
<span class="i0">Must loss of fame, peace, purity deplore;</span>
<span class="i0">Sinners with praise will pierce thee to the heart,</span>
<span class="i0">And saints deriding, tell thee what thou art.”</span>
<span class="i2">Such was his fall; and Edward, from that time,</span>
<span class="i0">Felt in full force the censure and the crime&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Despised, ashamed; his noble views before,</span>
<span class="i0">And his proud thoughts, degraded him the more. <span class="linenum">310</span></span>
<span class="i0">Should he repent&mdash;would that conceal his shame?</span>
<span class="i0">Could peace be his? It perish’d with his fame.</span>
<span class="i0">Himself he scorn’d, nor could his crime forgive;</span>
<span class="i0">He fear’d to die, yet felt ashamed to live;</span>
<span class="i0">Grieved, but not contrite was his heart&mdash;oppress’d,</span>
<span class="i0">Not broken; not converted, but distress’d;</span>
<span class="i0">He wanted will to bend the stubborn knee,<span class="ws12">&nbsp;}</span></span>
<span class="i0">He wanted light the cause of ill to see,<span class="ws16">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">To learn how frail is man, how humble then should be;&nbsp;&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">For faith he had not, or a faith too weak <span class="linenum">320</span></span>
<span class="i0">To gain the help that humbled sinners seek;</span>
<span class="i0">Else had he pray’d&mdash;to an offended God</span>
<span class="i0">His tears had flown a penitential flood;</span>
<span class="i0">Though far astray, he would have heard the call</span>
<span class="i0">Of mercy&mdash;“Come! return, thou prodigal;”</span>
<span class="i0">Then, though confused, distress’d, ashamed, afraid,</span>
<span class="i0">Still had the trembling penitent obey’d;</span>
<span class="i0">Though faith had fainted, when assail’d by fear,</span>
<span class="i0">Hope to the soul had whisper’d, “Persevere!”</span>
<span class="i0">Till, in his Father’s house an humbled guest, <span class="linenum">330</span></span>
<span class="i0">He would have found forgiveness, comfort, rest.</span>
<span class="i2">But all this joy was to our youth denied</span>
<span class="i0">By his fierce passions and his daring pride;</span>
<span class="i0">And shame and doubt impell’d him in a course,</span>
<span class="i0">Once so abhorr’d, with unresisted force.</span>
<span class="i0">Proud minds and guilty, whom their crimes oppress,</span>
<span class="i0">Fly to new crimes for comfort and redress;</span>
<span class="i0">So found our fallen youth a short relief</span>
<span class="i0">In wine, the opiate guilt applies to grief&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">From fleeting mirth that o’er the bottle lives; <span class="linenum">340</span></span>
<span class="i0">From the false joy its inspiration gives;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And from associates, pleased to find a friend</span>
<span class="i0">With powers to lead them, gladden, and defend,</span>
<span class="i0">In all those scenes where transient ease is found</span>
<span class="i0">For minds whom sins oppress, and sorrows wound.</span>
<span class="i2">Wine is like anger; for it makes us strong,<span class="ws7">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Blind and impatient, and it leads us wrong;<span class="ws8">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">The strength is quickly lost, we feel the error long.&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">Thus led, thus strengthen’d in an evil cause</span>
<span class="i0">For folly pleading, sought the youth applause; <span class="linenum">350</span></span>
<span class="i0">Sad for a time, then eloquently wild,</span>
<span class="i0">He gaily spoke as his companions smiled;</span>
<span class="i0">Lightly he rose, and with his former grace</span>
<span class="i0">Proposed some doubt, and argued on the case;</span>
<span class="i0">Fate and fore-knowledge were his favourite themes&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">How vain man’s purpose, how absurd his schemes:</span>
<span class="i0">“Whatever is, was ere our birth decreed;<span class="ws6">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">We think our actions from ourselves proceed,&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">And idly we lament th’ inevitable deed;<span class="ws6">&nbsp;}</span></span>
<span class="i0">It seems our own, but there’s a power above <span class="linenum">360</span></span>
<span class="i0">Directs the motion, nay, that makes us move;</span>
<span class="i0">Nor good nor evil can you beings name,</span>
<span class="i0">Who are but rooks and castles in the game;</span>
<span class="i0">Superior natures with their puppets play,</span>
<span class="i0">Till, bagg’d or buried, all are swept away.”</span>
<span class="i2">Such were the notions of a mind to ill</span>
<span class="i0">Now prone, but ardent and determined still.</span>
<span class="i0">Of joy now eager, as before of fame,</span>
<span class="i0">And screen’d by folly when assail’d by shame,</span>
<span class="i0">Deeply he sank; obey’d each passion’s call, <span class="linenum">370</span></span>
<span class="i0">And used his reason to defend them all.</span>
<span class="i0">Shall I proceed, and step by step relate</span>
<span class="i0">The odious progress of a sinner’s fate?</span>
<span class="i0">No&mdash;let me rather hasten to the time</span>
<span class="i0">(Sure to arrive) when misery waits on crime.</span>
<span class="i2">With virtue, prudence fled; what Shore possess’d</span>
<span class="i0">Was sold, was spent, and he was now distress’d;</span>
<span class="i0">And Want, unwelcome stranger, pale and wan,</span>
<span class="i0">Met with her haggard looks the hurried man;</span>
<span class="i0">His pride felt keenly what he must expect <span class="linenum">380</span></span>
<span class="i0">From useless pity and from cold neglect.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
<span class="i2">Struck by new terrors, from his friends he fled,</span>
<span class="i0">And wept his woes upon a restless bed;</span>
<span class="i0">Retiring late, at early hour to rise,</span>
<span class="i0">With shrunken features, and with bloodshot eyes.</span>
<span class="i0">If sleep one moment closed the dismal view,</span>
<span class="i0">Fancy her terrors built upon the true;</span>
<span class="i0">And night and day had their alternate woes,</span>
<span class="i0">That baffled pleasure, and that mock’d repose;</span>
<span class="i0">Till to despair and anguish was consign’d <span class="linenum">390</span></span>
<span class="i0">The wreck and ruin of a noble mind.</span>
<span class="i2">Now seized for debt, and lodged within a jail,</span>
<span class="i0">He tried his friendships, and he found them fail;</span>
<span class="i0">Then fail’d his spirits, and his thoughts were all</span>
<span class="i0">Fix’d on his sins, his sufferings, and his fall.</span>
<span class="i0">His ruffled mind was pictured in his face,</span>
<span class="i0">Once the fair seat of dignity and grace;</span>
<span class="i0">Great was the danger of a man so prone</span>
<span class="i0">To think of madness, and to think alone;</span>
<span class="i0">Yet pride still lived, and struggled to sustain <span class="linenum">400</span></span>
<span class="i0">The drooping spirit and the roving brain;</span>
<span class="i0">But this too fail’d: a friend his freedom gave,</span>
<span class="i0">And sent him help the threat’ning world to brave;</span>
<span class="i0">Gave solid counsel what to seek or flee,</span>
<span class="i0">But still would stranger to his person be:</span>
<span class="i0">In vain! the truth determined to explore,</span>
<span class="i0">He traced the friend whom he had wrong’d before.</span>
<span class="i2">This was too much; both aided and advised</span>
<span class="i0">By one who shunn’d him, pitied, and despised,</span>
<span class="i0">He bore it not; ’twas a deciding stroke, <span class="linenum">410</span></span>
<span class="i0">And on his reason like a torrent broke:</span>
<span class="i0">In dreadful stillness he appear’d awhile,</span>
<span class="i0">With vacant horror and a ghastly smile;</span>
<span class="i0">Then rose at once into the frantic rage,</span>
<span class="i0">That force controll’d not, nor could love assuage.</span>
<span class="i2">Friends now appear’d, but in the man was seen</span>
<span class="i0">The angry maniac, with vindictive mien;</span>
<span class="i0">Too late their pity gave to care and skill</span>
<span class="i0">The hurried mind and ever-wandering will;</span>
<span class="i0">Unnoticed pass’d all time, and not a ray <span class="linenum">420</span></span>
<span class="i0">Of reason broke on his benighted way;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But now he spurn’d the straw in pure disdain,</span>
<span class="i0">And now laugh’d loudly at the clinking chain.</span>
<span class="i2">Then, as its wrath subsided, by degrees</span>
<span class="i0">The mind sank slowly to infantine ease;</span>
<span class="i0">To playful folly, and to causeless joy,</span>
<span class="i0">Speech without aim, and without end, employ;</span>
<span class="i0">He drew fantastic figures on the wall,</span>
<span class="i0">And gave some wild relation of them all;</span>
<span class="i0">With brutal shape he join’d the human face, <span class="linenum">430</span></span>
<span class="i0">And idiot smiles approved the motley race.</span>
<span class="i2">Harmless at length th’ unhappy man was found,</span>
<span class="i0">The spirit settled, but the reason drown’d;</span>
<span class="i0">And all the dreadful tempest died away,</span>
<span class="i0">To the dull stillness of the misty day.</span>
<span class="i2">And now his freedom he attain’d&mdash;if free,</span>
<span class="i0">The lost to reason, truth, and hope, can be;</span>
<span class="i0">His friends, or wearied with the charge, or sure</span>
<span class="i0">The harmless wretch was now beyond a cure,</span>
<span class="i0">Gave him to wander where he pleased, and find <span class="linenum">440</span></span>
<span class="i0">His own resources for the eager mind;</span>
<span class="i0">The playful children of the place he meets,</span>
<span class="i0">Playful with them he rambles through the streets;</span>
<span class="i0">In all they need, his stronger arm he lends,</span>
<span class="i0">And his lost mind to these approving friends.</span>
<span class="i2">That gentle maid, whom once the youth had loved,</span>
<span class="i0">Is now with mild religious pity moved;</span>
<span class="i0">Kindly she chides his boyish flights, while he</span>
<span class="i0">Will for a moment fix’d and pensive be;</span>
<span class="i0">And, as she trembling speaks, his lively eyes <span class="linenum">450</span></span>
<span class="i0">Explore her looks, he listens to her sighs;</span>
<span class="i0">Charm’d by her voice, th’ harmonious sounds invade</span>
<span class="i0">His clouded mind, and for a time persuade:</span>
<span class="i0">Like a pleased infant, who has newly caught</span>
<span class="i0">From the maternal glance a gleam of thought;</span>
<span class="i0">He stands enrapt, the half-known voice to hear,</span>
<span class="i0">And starts, half-conscious, at the falling tear.</span>
<span class="i2">Rarely from town, nor then unwatch’d, he goes,</span>
<span class="i0">In darker mood, as if to hide his woes;</span>
<span class="i0">Returning soon, he with impatience seeks <span class="linenum">460</span></span>
<span class="i0">His youthful friends, and shouts, and sings, and speaks;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Speaks a wild speech with action all as wild&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">The children’s leader, and himself a child;</span>
<span class="i0">He spins their top, or, at their bidding, bends</span>
<span class="i0">His back, while o’er it leap his laughing friends;</span>
<span class="i0">Simple and weak, he acts the boy once more,</span>
<span class="i0">And heedless children call him Silly Shore.</span>

<span class="i0">’Squire Thomas flatter’d long a wealthy aunt,</span>
<span class="i0">Who left him all that she could give or grant:</span>
<span class="i0">Ten years he tried, with all his craft and skill,</span>
<span class="i0">To fix the sovereign lady’s varying will;</span>
<span class="i0">Ten years enduring at her board to sit,</span>
<span class="i0">He meekly listen’d to her tales and wit;</span>
<span class="i0">He took the meanest office man can take,</span>
<span class="i0">And his aunt’s vices for her money’s sake.</span>
<span class="i0">By many a threat’ning hint she waked his fear,</span>

<span class="i0">Yet all the taunts of her contemptuous pride</span>

<span class="i0">Fawning he smiled, and justice call’d th’ abuse;</span>
<span class="i0">“They taught you nothing; are you not, at best,”,<span class="ws7">&nbsp;}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Said the proud dame, “a trifler, and a jest?,<span class="ws11">&nbsp; }</span></span>
<span class="i0">Confess you are a fool!”&mdash;he bow’d, and he confess’d.&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i2">This vex’d him much, but could not always last:</span>
<span class="i0">The dame is buried, and the trial past.</span>
<span class="i2">There was a female, who had courted long <span class="linenum">20</span></span>
<span class="i0">Her cousin’s gifts, and deeply felt the wrong;</span>
<span class="i0">By a vain boy forbidden to attend</span>
<span class="i0">The private councils of her wealthy friend,</span>
<span class="i0">She vow’d revenge, nor should that crafty boy</span>
<span class="i0">In triumph undisturb’d his spoils enjoy;</span>

<span class="i0">Kindly dismiss’d the kindred of the dead;</span>

<span class="i0">“The dear deceased,” he call’d her, and the crowd</span>

<span class="i0">Found he was rich, and fancied he must please.</span>

<span class="i0">The wife he wish’d, if he had sought around;</span>
<span class="i0">For there were lasses of his own degree,</span>
<span class="i0">With no more hatred to the state than he;</span>
<span class="i0">But he had courted spleen and age so long,</span>
<span class="i0">His heart refused to woo the fair and young;</span>
<span class="i0">So long attended on caprice and whim,</span>
<span class="i0">He thought attention now was due to him;</span>
<span class="i0">And as his flattery pleased the wealthy dame, <span class="linenum">40</span></span>
<span class="i0">Heir to the wealth he might the flattery claim;</span>
<span class="i0">But this the fair with one accord denied,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor waved for man’s caprice the sex’s pride.</span>
<span class="i0">There is a season when to them is due</span>
<span class="i0">Worship and awe, and they will claim it too:</span>
<span class="i0">“Fathers,” they cry, “long hold us in their chain,</span>
<span class="i0">Nay, tyrant brothers claim a right to reign;</span>
<span class="i0">Uncles and guardians we in turn obey,</span>
<span class="i0">And husbands rule with ever-during sway;</span>
<span class="i0">Short is the time when lovers at the feet <span class="linenum">50</span></span>
<span class="i0">Of beauty kneel, and own the slavery sweet;</span>
<span class="i0">And shall we this our triumph, this the aim</span>
<span class="i0">And boast of female power, forbear to claim?</span>
<span class="i0">No! we demand that homage, that respect,</span>
<span class="i0">Or the proud rebel punish and reject.”</span>
<span class="i2">Our hero, still too indolent, too nice</span>
<span class="i0">To pay for beauty the accustom’d price,</span>
<span class="i0">No less forbore t’ address the humbler maid,</span>
<span class="i0">Who might have yielded with the price unpaid;</span>
<span class="i0">But lived, himself to humour and to please, <span class="linenum">60</span></span>
<span class="i0">To count his money, and enjoy his ease.</span>
<span class="i2">It pleased a neighbouring ’squire to recommend</span>
<span class="i0">A faithful youth, as servant to his friend;</span>
<span class="i0">Nay, more than servant, whom he praised for parts</span>
<span class="i0">Ductile yet strong, and for the best of hearts;</span>
<span class="i0">One who might ease him in his small affairs,</span>
<span class="i0">With tenants, tradesmen, taxes, and repairs;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Answer his letters, look to all his dues,</span>
<span class="i0">And entertain him with discourse and news.</span>
<span class="i2">The ’squire believed, and found the trusted youth <span class="linenum">70</span></span>
<span class="i0">A very pattern for his care and truth;</span>
<span class="i0">Not for his virtues to be praised alone,</span>
<span class="i0">But for a modest mien and humble tone;</span>
<span class="i0">Assenting always, but as if he meant</span>
<span class="i0">Only to strength of reasons to assent:</span>
<span class="i0">For was he stubborn, and retain’d his doubt,</span>
<span class="i0">Till the more subtle ’squire had forced it out;</span>
<span class="i0">Nay, still was right, but he perceived that strong</span>
<span class="i0">And powerful minds could make the right the wrong.</span>
<span class="i2">When the ’squire’s thoughts on some fair damsel dwelt, <span class="linenum">80</span></span>
<span class="i0">The faithful friend his apprehensions felt;</span>
<span class="i0">It would rejoice his faithful heart to find</span>
<span class="i0">A lady suited to his master’s mind;</span>
<span class="i0">But who deserved that master? who would prove</span>
<span class="i0">That hers was pure, uninterested love?</span>
<span class="i0">Although a servant, he would scorn to take</span>
<span class="i0">A countess, till she suffer’d for his sake;</span>
<span class="i0">Some tender spirit, humble, faithful, true,</span>
<span class="i0">Such, my dear master! must be sought for you.</span>
<span class="i2">Six months had pass’d, and not a lady seen, <span class="linenum">90</span></span>
<span class="i0">With just this love, ’twixt fifty and fifteen;</span>
<span class="i0">All seem’d his doctrine or his pride to shun,</span>
<span class="i0">All would be woo’d, before they would be won;</span>
<span class="i0">When the chance naming of a race and fair</span>
<span class="i0">Our ’squire disposed to take his pleasure there.</span>
<span class="i0">The friend profess’d, “although he first began</span>
<span class="i0">To hint the thing, it seem’d a thoughtless plan:</span>
<span class="i0">The roads, he fear’d, were foul, the days were short,</span>
<span class="i0">The village far, and yet there might be sport.”</span>
<span class="i2">“What! you of roads and starless nights afraid? <span class="linenum">100</span></span>
<span class="i0">You think to govern! you to be obey’d!”</span>
<span class="i0">Smiling he spoke; the humble friend declared</span>
<span class="i0">His soul’s obedience, and to go prepared.</span>
<span class="i2">The place was distant, but with great delight</span>
<span class="i0">They saw a race, and hail’d the glorious sight:</span>
<span class="i0">The ’squire exulted, and declared the ride</span>
<span class="i0">Had amply paid, and he was satisfied.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
<span class="i0">They gazed, they feasted, and, in happy mood,</span>
<span class="i0">Homeward return’d, and hastening as they rode;</span>
<span class="i0">For short the day, and sudden was the change <span class="linenum">110</span></span>
<span class="i0">From light to darkness, and the way was strange;</span>
<span class="i0">Our hero soon grew peevish, then distress’d;</span>
<span class="i0">He dreaded darkness, and he sigh’d for rest:</span>
<span class="i0">Going, they pass’d a village; but, alas!</span>
<span class="i0">Returning saw no village to repass;</span>
<span class="i0">The ’squire remember’d too a noble hall,</span>
<span class="i0">Large as a church, and whiter than its wall:</span>
<span class="i0">This he had noticed as they rode along,</span>
<span class="i0">And justly reason’d that their road was wrong.</span>
<span class="i0">George, full of awe, was modest in reply&mdash; <span class="linenum">120</span></span>
<span class="i0">“The fault was his, ’twas folly to deny;</span>
<span class="i0">And of his master’s safety were he sure,</span>
<span class="i0">There was no grievance he would not endure.”</span>
<span class="i0">This made his peace with the relenting ’squire,</span>
<span class="i0">Whose thoughts yet dwelt on supper and a fire;</span>
<span class="i0">When, as they reach’d a long and pleasant green,</span>
<span class="i0">Dwellings of men, and next a man, were seen.</span>
<span class="i2">“My friend,” said George, “to travellers astray</span>
<span class="i0">Point out an inn, and guide us on the way.”</span>
<span class="i2">The man look’d up; “Surprising! can it be <span class="linenum">130</span></span>
<span class="i0">My master’s son? as I’m alive, ’tis he.”</span>
<span class="i2">“How! Robin,” George replied, “and are we near</span>
<span class="i0">My father’s house? how strangely things appear!&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Dear sir, though wanderers, we at last are right:</span>
<span class="i0">Let us proceed, and glad my father’s sight;</span>
<span class="i0">We shall at least be fairly lodged and fed,</span>
<span class="i0">I can ensure a supper and a bed;</span>
<span class="i0">Let us this night, as one of pleasure date,</span>
<span class="i0">And of surprise: it is an act of fate.”</span>
<span class="i0">“Go on,” the ’squire in happy temper cried; <span class="linenum">140</span></span>
<span class="i0">“I like such blunder! I approve such guide.”</span>
<span class="i2">They ride, they halt; the farmer comes in haste;</span>
<span class="i0">Then tells his wife how much their house is graced;</span>
<span class="i0">They bless the chance, they praise the lucky son,</span>
<span class="i0">That caused the error.&mdash;Nay! it was not one,</span>
<span class="i0">But their good fortune&mdash;Cheerful grew the ’squire,</span>
<span class="i0">Who found dependants, flattery, wine, and fire;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
<span class="i0">He heard the jack turn round; the busy dame,<span class="ws13">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Produced her damask; and with supper came,<span class="ws13">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">The daughter, dress’d with care, and full of  maiden-shame.&emsp;}<span class="linenum">150</span></span>
<span class="i2">Surprised, our hero saw the air and dress,</span>
<span class="i0">And strove his admiration to express;</span>
<span class="i0">Nay! felt it too&mdash;for Harriot was, in truth,</span>
<span class="i0">A tall fair beauty in the bloom of youth;</span>
<span class="i0">And, from the pleasure and surprise, a grace</span>
<span class="i0">Adorn’d the blooming damsel’s form and face;</span>
<span class="i0">Then too, such high respect and duty paid</span>
<span class="i0">By all&mdash;such silent reverence in the maid;</span>
<span class="i0">Vent’ring with caution, yet with haste, a glance;</span>
<span class="i0">Loth to retire, yet trembling to advance, <span class="linenum">160</span></span>
<span class="i0">Appear’d the nymph, and in her gentle guest</span>
<span class="i0">Stirr’d soft emotions till the hour of rest.</span>
<span class="i0">Sweet was his sleep, and in the morn again</span>
<span class="i0">He felt a mixture of delight and pain:</span>
<span class="i0">“How fair, how gentle,” said the ’squire, “how meek,</span>
<span class="i0">And yet how sprightly, when disposed to speak!</span>
<span class="i0">Nature has bless’d her form, and Heaven her mind,</span>
<span class="i0">But in her favours Fortune is unkind;</span>
<span class="i0">Poor is the maid&mdash;nay, poor she cannot prove</span>
<span class="i0">Who is enrich’d with beauty, worth, and love.” <span class="linenum">170</span></span>
<span class="i2">The ’squire arose, with no precise intent</span>
<span class="i0">To go or stay&mdash;uncertain what he meant.</span>
<span class="i0">He moved to part&mdash;they begg’d him first to dine;</span>
<span class="i0">And who could then escape from love and wine?</span>
<span class="i0">As came the night, more charming grew the fair,</span>
<span class="i0">And seem’d to watch him with a two-fold care:</span>
<span class="i0">On the third morn, resolving not to stay,</span>
<span class="i0">Though urged by love, he bravely rode away.</span>
<span class="i2">Arrived at home, three pensive days he gave</span>
<span class="i0">To feelings fond and meditations grave; <span class="linenum">180</span></span>
<span class="i0">Lovely she was, and, if he did not err,</span>
<span class="i0">As fond of him as his fond heart of her;</span>
<span class="i0">Still he delay’d, unable to decide</span>
<span class="i0">Which was the master-passion, love or pride:</span>
<span class="i0">He sometimes wonder’d how his friend could make,</span>
<span class="i0">And then exulted in, the night’s mistake;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Had she but fortune, “doubtless then,” he cried,</span>
<span class="i0">“Some happier man had won the wealthy bride.”</span>
<span class="i2">While thus he hung in balance, now inclined</span>
<span class="i0">To change his state, and then to change his mind&mdash; <span class="linenum">190</span></span>
<span class="i0">That careless George dropp’d idly on the ground</span>
<span class="i0">A letter, which his crafty master found;</span>
<span class="i0">The stupid youth confess’d his fault, and pray’d</span>
<span class="i0">The generous ’squire to spare a gentle maid;</span>
<span class="i0">Of whom her tender mother, full of fears,</span>
<span class="i0">Had written much&mdash;“She caught her oft in tears,</span>
<span class="i0">For ever thinking on a youth above</span>
<span class="i0">Her humble fortune&mdash;still she own’d not love;</span>
<span class="i0">Nor can define, dear girl! the cherish’d pain,</span>
<span class="i0">But would rejoice to see the cause again. <span class="linenum">200</span></span>
<span class="i0">That neighbouring youth, whom she endured before,</span>
<span class="i0">She now rejects, and will behold no more;</span>
<span class="i0">Raised by her passion, she no longer stoops</span>
<span class="i0">To her own equals, but she pines and droops:</span>
<span class="i0">Like to a lily, on whose sweets the sun</span>
<span class="i0">Has withering gazed&mdash;she saw and was undone.</span>
<span class="i0">His wealth allured her not&mdash;nor was she moved</span>
<span class="i0">By his superior state, himself she loved:</span>
<span class="i0">So mild, so good, so gracious, so genteel&mdash;<span class="ws12">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">But spare your sister, and her love conceal;,<span class="ws12">}</span><span class="linenum">210</span></span>
<span class="i0">We must the fault forgive, since she the pain must feel.”&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i2">“Fault!” said the ’squire, “there’s coarseness in the mind</span>
<span class="i0">That thus conceives of feelings so refined;</span>
<span class="i0">Here end my doubts, nor blame yourself, my friend,</span>
<span class="i0">Fate made you careless&mdash;here my doubts have end.”</span>
<span class="i2">The way is plain before us&mdash;there is now</span>
<span class="i0">The lover’s visit first, and then the vow</span>
<span class="i0">Mutual and fond, the marriage-rite, the bride</span>
<span class="i0">Brought to her home with all a husband’s pride;</span>
<span class="i0">The ’squire receives the prize his merits won, <span class="linenum">220</span></span>
<span class="i0">And the glad parents leave the patron-son.</span>
<span class="i2">But in short time he saw with much surprise, <span class="ws10">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">First gloom, then grief, and then resentment rise, <span class="ws9">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">From proud, commanding frowns and anger-darting eyes:&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">“Is there in Harriot’s humble mind this fire,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
<span class="i0">This fierce impatience?” ask’d the puzzled ’squire:</span>
<span class="i0">“Has marriage changed her? or the mask she wore</span>
<span class="i0">Has she thrown by, and is herself once more?”</span>
<span class="i2">Hour after hour, when clouds on clouds appear,</span>

<span class="i0">And thus the frowning brow, the restless form,</span>
<span class="i0">And threat’ning glance, forerun domestic storm:</span>
<span class="i0">So read the husband, and, with troubled mind,</span>
<span class="i0">Reveal’d his fears&mdash;“My love, I hope you find</span>
<span class="i0">All here is pleasant&mdash;but I must confess<span class="ws12">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">You seem offended, or in some distress;<span class="ws12">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Explain the grief you feel, and leave me to redress.” &emsp;}</span>
<span class="i2">“Leave it to you?” replied the nymph&mdash;“indeed!</span>
<span class="i0">What&mdash;to the cause from whence the ills proceed?</span>
<span class="i0">Good Heaven! to take me from a place, where I <span class="linenum">240</span></span>

<span class="i0">The easiest way to give the deepest wound;</span>
<span class="i0">But then, like fencers, they were equal still,</span>
<span class="i0">Both lost in danger what they gain’d in skill;</span>
<span class="i0">Each heart a keener kind of rancour gain’d, <span class="linenum">360</span></span>
<span class="i0">And paining more, was more severely pain’d;</span>
<span class="i0">And thus by both were equal vengeance dealt,</span>
<span class="i0">And both the anguish they inflicted felt.</span>

<p class="f110"><i>JESSE AND COLIN.</i></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">A vicar died, and left his daughter poor&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">It hurt her not, she was not rich before:</span>
<span class="i0">Her humble share of worldly goods she sold,</span>
<span class="i0">Paid every debt, and then her fortune told;</span>
<span class="i0">And found, with youth and beauty, hope and health,</span>
<span class="i0">Two hundred guineas was her worldly wealth;</span>
<span class="i0">It then remain’d to choose her path in life,</span>
<span class="i0">And first, said Jesse, “Shall I be a wife?&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Colin is mild and civil, kind and just,</span>
<span class="i0">I know his love, his temper I can trust; <span class="linenum">10</span></span>
<span class="i0">But small his farm, it asks perpetual care,</span>
<span class="i0">And we must toil as well as trouble share.</span>
<span class="i0">True, he was taught in all the gentle arts</span>
<span class="i0">That raise the soul, and soften human hearts,</span>
<span class="i0">And boasts a parent, who deserves to shine</span>
<span class="i0">In higher class, and I could wish her mine;</span>
<span class="i0">Nor wants he will his station to improve,</span>
<span class="i0">A just ambition waked by faithful love;&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Still is he poor&mdash;and here my father’s friend</span>
<span class="i0">Deigns for his daughter, as her own, to send; <span class="linenum">20</span></span>
<span class="i0">A worthy lady, who it seems has known</span>
<span class="i0">A world of griefs and troubles of her own.</span>
<span class="i0">I was an infant, when she came, a guest</span>
<span class="i0">Beneath my father’s humble roof to rest;</span>
<span class="i0">Her kindred all unfeeling, vast her woes;</span>
<span class="i0">Such her complaint, and there she found repose;</span>
<span class="i0">Enrich’d by fortune, now she nobly lives,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And nobly, from the blest abundance, gives;</span>
<span class="i0">The grief, the want of human life, she knows,</span>
<span class="i0">And comfort there and here relief bestows; <span class="linenum">30</span></span>
<span class="i0">But are they not dependants?&mdash;Foolish pride!</span>
<span class="i0">Am I not honour’d by such friend and guide?</span>
<span class="i0">Have I a home,” (here Jesse dropp’d a tear,)</span>
<span class="i0">“Or friend beside?”&mdash;A faithful friend was near.</span>
<span class="i2">Now Colin came, at length resolved to lay</span>
<span class="i0">His heart before her and to urge her stay;</span>
<span class="i0">True, his own plough the gentle Colin drove,</span>
<span class="i0">An humble farmer with aspiring love;</span>
<span class="i0">Who, urged by passion, never dared till now,</span>
<span class="i0">Thus urged by fears, his trembling hopes avow. <span class="linenum">40</span></span>
<span class="i0">Her father’s glebe he managed; every year</span>
<span class="i0">The grateful vicar held the youth more dear;</span>
<span class="i0">He saw indeed the prize in Colin’s view,</span>
<span class="i0">And wish’d his Jesse with a man so true;</span>
<span class="i0">Timid as true, he urged with anxious air</span>
<span class="i0">His tender hope, and made the trembling prayer;</span>
<span class="i0">When Jesse saw, nor could with coldness see,</span>
<span class="i0">Such fond respect, such tried sincerity,</span>
<span class="i0">Grateful for favours to her father dealt,</span>
<span class="i0">She more than grateful for his passion felt; <span class="linenum">50</span></span>
<span class="i0">Nor could she frown on one so good and kind,</span>
<span class="i0">Yet fear’d to smile, and was unfix’d in mind;</span>
<span class="i0">But prudence placed the female friend in view&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">What might not one so rich and grateful do?</span>
<span class="i0">So lately, too, the good old vicar died,<span class="ws8">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">His faithful daughter must not cast aside<span class="ws6">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">The signs of filial grief, and be a ready bride:&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">Thus, led by prudence, to the lady’s seat</span>
<span class="i0">The village-beauty purposed to retreat;</span>
<span class="i0">But, as in hard-fought fields the victor knows <span class="linenum">60</span></span>
<span class="i0">What to the vanquish’d he, in honour, owes,</span>
<span class="i0">So, in this conquest over powerful love,</span>
<span class="i0">Prudence resolved a generous foe to prove;</span>
<span class="i0">And Jesse felt a mingled fear and pain</span>
<span class="i0">In her dismission of a faithful swain,</span>
<span class="i0">Gave her kind thanks, and when she saw his wo,</span>
<span class="i0">Kindly betray’d that she was loth to go.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But would she promise, if abroad she met<span class="ws13">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">A frowning world, she would remember yet<span class="ws11">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">“Where dwelt a friend?”&mdash;“That could she not forget.”&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">And thus they parted; but each faithful heart <span class="linenum">71</span></span>
<span class="i0">Felt the compulsion, and refused to part.</span>
<span class="i2">Now by the morning mail the timid maid</span>
<span class="i0">Was to that kind and wealthy dame convey’d;</span>
<span class="i0">Whose invitation, when her father died,</span>
<span class="i0">Jesse as comfort to her heart applied.</span>
<span class="i0">She knew the days her generous friend had seen&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">As wife and widow, evil days had been;</span>
<span class="i0">She married early, and for half her life</span>
<span class="i0">Was an insulted and forsaken wife; <span class="linenum">80</span></span>
<span class="i0">Widow’d and poor, her angry father gave,</span>
<span class="i0">Mix’d with reproach, the pittance of a slave;</span>
<span class="i0">Forgetful brothers pass’d her, but she knew</span>
<span class="i0">Her humbler friends, and to their home withdrew;</span>
<span class="i0">The good old vicar to her sire applied</span>
<span class="i0">For help, and help’d her when her sire denied;</span>
<span class="i0">When in few years death stalk’d through bower and hall,</span>
<span class="i0">Sires, sons, and sons of sons, were buried all;</span>
<span class="i0">She then abounded, and had wealth to spare</span>
<span class="i0">For softening grief she once was doom’d to share; <span class="linenum">90</span></span>
<span class="i0">Thus train’d in misery’s school, and taught to feel,</span>
<span class="i0">She would rejoice an orphan’s woes to heal.</span>
<span class="i0">So Jesse thought, who look’d within her breast,</span>
<span class="i0">And thence conceived how bounteous minds are bless’d.</span>
<span class="i2">From her vast mansion look’d the lady down</span>
<span class="i0">On humbler buildings of a busy town;</span>
<span class="i0">Thence came her friends of either sex, and all</span>
<span class="i0">With whom she lived on terms reciprocal.</span>
<span class="i0">They pass’d the hours with their accustom’d ease,</span>
<span class="i0">As guests inclined, but not compell’d to please; <span class="linenum">100</span></span>
<span class="i0">But there were others in the mansion found,</span>
<span class="i0">For office chosen, and by duties bound;</span>
<span class="i0">Three female rivals, each of power possess’d,</span>
<span class="i0">Th’ attendant-maid, poor friend, and kindred-guest.</span>
<span class="i2">To these came Jesse, as a seaman thrown</span>
<span class="i0">By the rude storm upon a coast unknown:</span>
<span class="i0">The view was flattering, civil seem’d the race,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But all unknown the dangers of the place.</span>
<span class="i2">Few hours had pass’d, when, from attendants freed,</span>
<span class="i0">The lady utter’d&mdash;“This is kind indeed; <span class="linenum">110</span></span>
<span class="i0">Believe me, love! that I for one like you</span>
<span class="i0">Have daily pray’d, a friend discreet and true;</span>
<span class="i0">Oh! wonder not that I on you depend,</span>
<span class="i0">You are mine own hereditary friend:</span>
<span class="i0">Hearken, my Jesse, never can I trust</span>
<span class="i0">Beings ungrateful, selfish, and unjust;</span>
<span class="i0">But you are present, and my load of care</span>
<span class="i0">Your love will serve to lighten and to share.</span>
<span class="i0">Come near me, Jesse&mdash;let not those below</span>
<span class="i0">Of my reliance on your friendship know; <span class="linenum">120</span></span>
<span class="i0">Look as they look, be in their freedoms free&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">But all they say do you convey to me.”</span>
<span class="i2">Here Jesse’s thoughts to Colin’s cottage flew,</span>
<span class="i0">And with such speed she scarce their absence knew.</span>
<span class="i2">“Jane loves her mistress, and should she depart,</span>
<span class="i0">I lose her service, and she breaks her heart;</span>
<span class="i0">My ways and wishes, looks and thoughts she knows,</span>
<span class="i0">And duteous care by close attention shows;</span>
<span class="i0">But is she faithful? in temptation strong?</span>
<span class="i0">Will she not wrong me? ah! I fear the wrong. <span class="linenum">130</span></span>
<span class="i0">Your father loved me; now, in time of need,</span>
<span class="i0">Watch for my good, and to his place succeed.</span>
<span class="i2">“Blood doesn’t bind&mdash;that girl, who every day</span>
<span class="i0">Eats of my bread, would wish my life away;</span>
<span class="i0">I am her <i>dear relation</i>, and she thinks</span>
<span class="i0">To make her fortune, an ambitious minx!</span>
<span class="i0">She only courts me for the prospect’s sake,</span>
<span class="i0">Because she knows I have a will to make;</span>
<span class="i0">Yes, love! my will delay’d, I know not how&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">But you are here, and I will make it now. <span class="linenum">140</span></span>
<span class="i2">“That idle creature, keep her in your view,</span>
<span class="i0">See what she does, what she desires to do;</span>
<span class="i0">On her young mind may artful villains prey,</span>
<span class="i0">And to my plate and jewels find a way;</span>
<span class="i0">A pleasant humour has the girl; her smile</span>
<span class="i0">And cheerful manner tedious hours beguile;</span>
<span class="i0">But well observe her, ever near her be,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Close in your thoughts, in your professions free.</span>
<span class="i2">“Again, my Jesse, hear what I advise,</span>
<span class="i0">And watch a woman ever in disguise; <span class="linenum">150</span></span>
<span class="i0">Issop, that widow, serious, subtle, sly&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">But what of this?&mdash;I must have company.</span>
<span class="i0">She markets for me, and although she makes</span>
<span class="i0">Profit, no doubt, of all she undertakes,</span>
<span class="i0">Yet she is one I can to all produce,</span>
<span class="i0">And all her talents are in daily use;</span>
<span class="i0">Deprived of her, I may another find</span>
<span class="i0">As sly and selfish, with a weaker mind:</span>
<span class="i0">But never trust her, she is full of art,</span>
<span class="i0">And worms herself into the closest heart; <span class="linenum">160</span></span>
<span class="i0">Seem then, I pray you, careless in her sight,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor let her know, my love, how we unite.</span>
<span class="i2">“Do, my good Jesse, cast a view around,</span>
<span class="i0">And let no wrong within my house be found;</span>
<span class="i0">That girl associates with&mdash;I know not who</span>
<span class="i0">Are her companions, nor what ill they do;</span>
<span class="i0">’Tis then the widow plans, ’tis then she tries</span>
<span class="i0">Her various arts and schemes for fresh supplies;</span>
<span class="i0">’Tis then, if ever, Jane her duty quits,</span>
<span class="i0">And, whom I know not, favours and admits: <span class="linenum">170</span></span>
<span class="i0">Oh! watch their movements all; for me ’tis hard,</span>
<span class="i0">Indeed is vain, but you may keep a guard;</span>
<span class="i0">And I, when none your watchful glance deceive,</span>
<span class="i0">May make my will, and think what I shall leave.”</span>
<span class="i2">Jesse, with fear, disgust, alarm, surprise,</span>
<span class="i0">Heard of these duties for her ears and eyes;</span>
<span class="i0">Heard by what service she must gain her bread,</span>
<span class="i0">And went with scorn and sorrow to her bed.</span>
<span class="i2">Jane was a servant fitted for her place,</span>
<span class="i0">Experienced, cunning, fraudful, selfish, base; <span class="linenum">180</span></span>
<span class="i0">Skill’d in those mean, humiliating arts</span>
<span class="i0">That make their way to proud and selfish hearts;</span>
<span class="i0">By instinct taught, she felt an awe, a fear,</span>
<span class="i0">For Jesse’s upright, simple character;</span>
<span class="i0">Whom with gross flattery she awhile assail’d,</span>
<span class="i0">And then beheld with hatred when it fail’d;</span>
<span class="i0">Yet, trying still upon her mind for hold,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
<span class="i0">She all the secrets of the mansion told;</span>
<span class="i0">And to invite an equal trust she drew</span>
<span class="i0">Of every mind a bold and rapid view; <span class="linenum">190</span></span>
<span class="i0">But on the widow’d friend with deep disdain,</span>
<span class="i0">And rancorous envy, dwelt the treacherous Jane.&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">In vain such arts; without deceit or pride,</span>
<span class="i0">With a just taste and feeling for her guide,</span>
<span class="i0">From all contagion Jesse kept apart,</span>
<span class="i0">Free in her manners, guarded in her heart.</span>
<span class="i2">Jesse one morn was thoughtful, and her sigh</span>
<span class="i0">The widow heard as she was passing by;</span>
<span class="i0">And&mdash;“Well!” she said, “is that some distant swain,</span>
<span class="i0">Or aught with us, that gives your bosom pain? <span class="linenum">200</span></span>
<span class="i0">Come, we are fellow-sufferers, slaves in thrall,</span>
<span class="i0">And tasks and griefs are common to us all;</span>
<span class="i0">Think not my frankness strange: they love to paint</span>
<span class="i0">Their state with freedom, who endure restraint;</span>
<span class="i0">And there is something in that speaking eye</span>
<span class="i0">And sober mien, that prove I may rely.</span>
<span class="i0">You came a stranger; to my words attend,</span>
<span class="i0">Accept my offer, and you find a friend;</span>
<span class="i0">It is a labyrinth in which you stray,</span>
<span class="i0">Come, hold my clue, and I will lead the way. <span class="linenum">210</span></span>
<span class="i2">“Good Heav’n! that one so jealous, envious, base,</span>
<span class="i0">Should be the mistress of so sweet a place;</span>
<span class="i0">She, who so long herself was low and poor,</span>
<span class="i0">Now broods suspicious on her useless store;</span>
<span class="i0">She loves to see us abject, loves to deal</span>
<span class="i0">Her insult round, and then pretends to feel;</span>
<span class="i0">Prepare to cast all dignity aside,</span>
<span class="i0">For know your talents will be quickly tried;</span>
<span class="i0">Nor think, from favours past, a friend to gain,</span>
<span class="i0">’Tis but by duties we our posts maintain: <span class="linenum">220</span></span>
<span class="i0">I read her novels, gossip through the town,</span>
<span class="i0">And daily go, for idle stories, down;</span>
<span class="i0">I cheapen all she buys, and bear the curse</span>
<span class="i0">Of honest tradesmen for my niggard-purse;</span>
<span class="i0">And, when for her this meanness I display,</span>
<span class="i0">She cries, ’I heed not what I throw away;’</span>
<span class="i0">Of secret bargains I endure the shame,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And stake my credit for our fish and game;</span>
<span class="i0">Oft has she smiled to hear, ’her generous soul</span>
<span class="i0">Would gladly give, but stoops to my control’; <span class="linenum">230</span></span>
<span class="i0">Nay! I have heard her, when she chanced to come</span>
<span class="i0">Where I contended for a petty sum,</span>
<span class="i0">Affirm ’twas painful to behold such care,</span>
<span class="i0">‘But Issop’s nature is to pinch and spare:’</span>
<span class="i0">Thus all the meanness of the house is mine,</span>
<span class="i0">And my reward&mdash;to scorn her, and to dine.</span>
<span class="i2">“See next that giddy thing, with neither pride</span>
<span class="i0">To keep her safe, nor principle to guide:</span>
<span class="i0">Poor, idle, simple flirt! as sure as fate</span>
<span class="i0">Her maiden-fame will have an early date. <span class="linenum">240</span></span>
<span class="i0">Of her beware; for all who live below</span>
<span class="i0">Have faults they wish not all the world to know;</span>
<span class="i0">And she is fond of listening, full of doubt,</span>
<span class="i0">And stoops to guilt to find an error out.</span>
<span class="i2">“And now once more observe the artful maid,</span>
<span class="i0">A lying, prying, jilting, thievish jade;</span>
<span class="i0">I think, my love, you would not condescend</span>
<span class="i0">To call a low, illiterate girl your friend;</span>
<span class="i0">But in our troubles we are apt, you know,</span>
<span class="i0">To lean on all who some compassion show; <span class="linenum">250</span></span>
<span class="i0">And she has flexile features, acting eyes,</span>
<span class="i0">And seems with every look to sympathise;</span>
<span class="i0">No mirror can a mortal’s grief express</span>
<span class="i0">With more precision, or can feel it less;</span>
<span class="i0">That proud, mean spirit, she by fawning courts,</span>
<span class="i0">By vulgar flattery, and by vile reports;</span>
<span class="i0">And by that proof she every instant gives</span>
<span class="i0">To one so mean, that yet a meaner lives.&mdash;</span>
<span class="i2">“Come, I have drawn the curtain, and you see</span>
<span class="i0">Your fellow-actors, all our company; <span class="linenum">260</span></span>
<span class="i0">Should you incline to throw reserve aside,</span>
<span class="i0">And in my judgment and my love confide,</span>
<span class="i0">I could some prospects open to your view,</span>
<span class="i0">That ask attention&mdash;and, till then, adieu.”</span>
<span class="i2">“Farewell!” said Jesse, hastening to her room,</span>
<span class="i0">Where all she saw within, without, was gloom:</span>
<span class="i0">Confused, perplex’d, she pass’d a dreary hour,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Before her reason could exert its power;</span>
<span class="i0">To her all seem’d mysterious, all allied</span>
<span class="i0">To avarice, meanness, folly, craft, and pride; <span class="linenum">270</span></span>
<span class="i0">Wearied with thought, she breathed the garden’s air,</span>
<span class="i0">Then came the laughing lass, and join’d her there.</span>
<span class="i2">“My sweetest friend has dwelt with us a week,</span>
<span class="i0">And does she love us? be sincere and speak;</span>
<span class="i0">My aunt you cannot&mdash;Lord! how I should hate</span>
<span class="i0">To be like her, all misery and state;</span>
<span class="i0">Proud, and yet envious, she disgusted sees</span>
<span class="i0">All who are happy, and who look at ease.</span>
<span class="i0">Let friendship bind us, I will quickly show</span>
<span class="i0">Some favourites near us you’ll be bless’d to know; <span class="linenum">280</span></span>
<span class="i0">My aunt forbids it&mdash;but, can she expect,</span>
<span class="i0">To soothe her spleen, we shall ourselves neglect?</span>
<span class="i0">Jane and the widow were to watch and stay</span>
<span class="i0">My free-born feet; I watch’d as well as they;</span>
<span class="i0">Lo! what is this? this simple key explores</span>
<span class="i0">The dark recess that holds the spinster’s stores;</span>
<span class="i0">And led by her ill star, I chanced to see</span>
<span class="i0">Where Issop keeps her stock of ratafie;</span>
<span class="i0">Used in the hours of anger and alarm,</span>
<span class="i0">It makes her civil, and it keeps her warm; <span class="linenum">290</span></span>
<span class="i0">Thus bless’d with secrets, both would choose to hide,</span>
<span class="i0">Their fears now grant me what their scorn denied.</span>
<span class="i2">“My freedom thus by their assent secured,</span>
<span class="i0">Bad as it is, the place may be endured;</span>
<span class="i0">And bad it is, but her estates, you know,</span>
<span class="i0">And her beloved hoards, she must bestow;</span>
<span class="i0">So we can slyly our amusements take,</span>
<span class="i0">And friends of dæmons, if they help us, make.”</span>
<span class="i2">“Strange creatures these,” thought Jesse, half inclined</span>
<span class="i0">To smile at one malicious and yet kind; <span class="linenum">300</span></span>
<span class="i0">Frank and yet cunning, with a heart to love</span>
<span class="i0">And malice prompt&mdash;the serpent and the dove;</span>
<span class="i0">Here could she dwell? or could she yet depart?</span>
<span class="i0">Could she be artful? could she bear with art?&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">This splendid mansion gave the cottage grace,</span>
<span class="i0">She thought a dungeon was a happier place;</span>
<span class="i0">And Colin pleading, when he pleaded best,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Wrought not such sudden change in Jesse’s breast.</span>
<span class="i2">The wondering maiden, who had only read</span>
<span class="i0">Of such vile beings, saw them now with dread; <span class="linenum">310</span></span>
<span class="i0">Safe in themselves&mdash;for nature has design’d</span>
<span class="i0">The creature’s poison harmless to the kind;</span>
<span class="i0">But all beside who in the haunts are found</span>
<span class="i0">Must dread the poison, and must feel the wound.</span>
<span class="i2">Days full of care, slow weary weeks pass’d on;</span>
<span class="i0">Eager to go, still Jesse was not gone;</span>
<span class="i0">Her time in trifling or in tears she spent,</span>
<span class="i0">She never gave, she never felt content:</span>
<span class="i0">The lady wonder’d that her humble guest</span>
<span class="i0">Strove not to please, would neither lie nor jest; <span class="linenum">320</span></span>
<span class="i0">She sought no news, no scandal would convey,</span>
<span class="i0">But walk’d for health, and was at church to pray;</span>
<span class="i0">All this displeased, and soon the widow cried:</span>
<span class="i0">“Let me be frank&mdash;I am not satisfied;</span>
<span class="i0">You know my wishes, I your judgment trust;</span>
<span class="i0">You can be useful, Jesse, and you must;</span>
<span class="i0">Let me be plainer, child&mdash;I want an ear,</span>
<span class="i0">When I am deaf, instead of mine to hear;</span>
<span class="i0">When mine is sleeping, let your eye awake;</span>
<span class="i0">When I observe not, observation take; <span class="linenum">330</span></span>
<span class="i0">Alas! I rest not on my pillow laid,</span>
<span class="i0">Then threat’ning whispers make my soul afraid;</span>
<span class="i0">The tread of strangers to my ear ascends,</span>
<span class="i0">Fed at my cost, the minions of my friends;</span>
<span class="i0">While you, without a care, a wish to please,</span>
<span class="i0">Eat the vile bread of idleness and ease.”</span>
<span class="i2">Th’ indignant girl astonish’d answer’d&mdash;“Nay!</span>
<span class="i0">This instant, madam, let me haste away;</span>
<span class="i0">Thus speaks my father’s, thus an orphan’s, friend?</span>
<span class="i0">This instant, lady, let your bounty end.” <span class="linenum">340</span></span>
<span class="i2">The lady frown’d indignant&mdash;“What!” she cried,</span>
<span class="i0">“A vicar’s daughter with a princess’ pride!</span>
<span class="i0">And pauper’s lot! but pitying I forgive;</span>
<span class="i0">How, simple Jesse, do you think to live?</span>
<span class="i0">Have I not power to help you, foolish maid?</span>
<span class="i0">To my concerns be your attention paid;</span>
<span class="i0">With cheerful mind th’ allotted duties take,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And recollect I have a will to make.”</span>
<span class="i2">Jesse, who felt as liberal natures feel,</span>
<span class="i0">When thus the baser their designs reveal, <span class="linenum">350</span></span>
<span class="i0">Replied&mdash;“Those duties were to her unfit,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor would her spirit to her tasks submit.”</span>
<span class="i2">In silent scorn the lady sate awhile,</span>
<span class="i0">And then replied with stern contemptuous smile&mdash;</span>
<span class="i2">“Think you, fair madam, that you came to share</span>
<span class="i0">Fortunes like mine without a thought or care?</span>
<span class="i0">A guest, indeed! from every trouble free,</span>
<span class="i0">Dress’d by my help, with not a care for me.</span>
<span class="i0">When I a visit to your father made,</span>
<span class="i0">I for the poor assistance largely paid; <span class="linenum">360</span></span>
<span class="i0">To his domestics I their tasks assign’d;</span>
<span class="i0">I fix’d the portion for his hungry hind;</span>
<span class="i0">And had your father (simple man!) obey’d</span>
<span class="i0">My good advice, and watch’d as well as pray’d,</span>
<span class="i0">He might have left you something with his prayers,</span>
<span class="i0">And lent some colour for these lofty airs.&mdash;</span>
<span class="i2">“In tears! my love! Oh, then my soften’d heart</span>
<span class="i0">Cannot resist&mdash;we never more will part;</span>
<span class="i0">I need your friendship&mdash;I will be your friend;</span>
<span class="i0">And thus determined, to my will attend.” <span class="linenum">370</span></span>
<span class="i2">Jesse went forth, but with determined soul</span>
<span class="i0">To fly such love, to break from such control;</span>
<span class="i0">“I hear enough,” the trembling damsel cried;</span>
<span class="i0">“Flight be my care, and Providence my guide:</span>
<span class="i0">Ere yet a prisoner, I escape will make; <span class="ws11">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Will, thus display’d, th’ insidious arts forsake,<span class="ws5">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And, as the rattle sounds, will fly the fatal snake.”&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i2">Jesse her thanks upon the morrow paid,</span>
<span class="i0">Prepared to go, determined though afraid.</span>
<span class="i2">“Ungrateful creature,” said the lady, “this <span class="linenum">380</span></span>
<span class="i0">Could I imagine?&mdash;are you frantic, miss?</span>
<span class="i0">What! leave your friend, your prospects&mdash;is it true?”</span>
<span class="i0">This Jesse answer’d by a mild “Adieu!”</span>
<span class="i2">The dame replied, “Then houseless may you rove,</span>
<span class="i0">The starving victim to a guilty love;</span>
<span class="i0">Branded with shame, in sickness doom’d to nurse</span>
<span class="i0">An ill-form’d cub, your scandal and your curse;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Spurn’d by its scoundrel father, and ill fed</span>
<span class="i0">By surly rustics with the parish-bread!&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Relent you not?&mdash;speak&mdash;yet I can forgive; <span class="linenum">390</span></span>
<span class="i0">Still live with me”&mdash;“With you,” said Jesse, “live?</span>
<span class="i0">No! I would first endure what you describe,</span>
<span class="i0">Rather than breathe with your detested tribe:</span>
<span class="i0">Who long have feign’d, till now their very hearts</span>
<span class="i0">Are firmly fix’d in their accursed parts;</span>
<span class="i0">Who all profess esteem, and feel disdain,</span>
<span class="i0">And all, with justice, of deceit complain;</span>
<span class="i0">Whom I could pity, but that, while I stay,</span>
<span class="i0">My terror drives all kinder thoughts away;</span>
<span class="i0">Grateful for this, that when I think of you, <span class="linenum">400</span></span>
<span class="i0">I little fear what poverty can do.”</span>
<span class="i2">The angry matron her attendant Jane</span>
<span class="i0">Summon’d in haste to soothe the fierce disdain.</span>
<span class="i2">“A vile detested wretch!” the lady cried,<span class="ws12">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">“Yet shall she be, by many an effort, tried,<span class="ws12">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And, clogg’d with debt and fear, against her will abide;&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">And, once secured, she never shall depart</span>
<span class="i0">Till I have proved the firmness of her heart;</span>
<span class="i0">Then when she dares not, would not, cannot go,</span>
<span class="i0">I’ll make her feel what ’tis to use me so.” <span class="linenum">410</span></span>
<span class="i2">The pensive Colin in his garden stray’d,</span>
<span class="i0">But felt not then the beauties it display’d;</span>
<span class="i0">There many a pleasant object met his view,</span>
<span class="i0">A rising wood of oaks behind it grew;</span>
<span class="i0">A stream ran by it, and the village-green</span>
<span class="i0">And public road were from the gardens seen;</span>
<span class="i0">Save where the pine and larch the bound’ry made,</span>
<span class="i0">And on the rose-beds threw a softening shade.</span>
<span class="i2">The mother sat beside the garden-door,</span>
<span class="i0">Dress’d as in times ere she and hers were poor; <span class="linenum">420</span></span>
<span class="i0">The broad-laced cap was known in ancient days,</span>
<span class="i0">When madam’s dress compell’d the village praise;</span>
<span class="i0">And still she look’d as in the times of old,</span>
<span class="i0">Ere his last farm the erring husband sold;</span>
<span class="i0">While yet the mansion stood in decent state,</span>
<span class="i0">And paupers waited at the well-known gate.</span>
<span class="i2">“Alas! my son!” the mother cried, “and why</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
<span class="i0">That silent grief and oft-repeated sigh?</span>
<span class="i0">True, we are poor, but thou hast never felt</span>
<span class="i0">Pangs to thy father for his error dealt; <span class="linenum">430</span></span>
<span class="i0">Pangs from strong hopes of visionary gain,</span>
<span class="i0">For ever raised, and ever found in vain.</span>
<span class="i0">He rose unhappy! from his fruitless schemes,</span>
<span class="i0">As guilty wretches from their blissful dreams;</span>
<span class="i0">But thou wert then, my son, a playful child,</span>
<span class="i0">Wondering at grief, gay, innocent, and wild;</span>
<span class="i0">Listening at times to thy poor mother’s sighs,</span>
<span class="i0">With curious looks and innocent surprise;</span>
<span class="i0">Thy father dying, thou, my virtuous boy,</span>
<span class="i0">My comfort always, waked my soul to joy; <span class="linenum">440</span></span>
<span class="i0">With the poor remnant of our fortune left,</span>
<span class="i0">Thou hast our station of its gloom bereft:</span>
<span class="i0">Thy lively temper, and thy cheerful air,</span>
<span class="i0">Have cast a smile on sadness and despair;</span>
<span class="i0">Thy active hand has dealt to this poor space</span>
<span class="i0">The bliss of plenty and the charm of grace;</span>
<span class="i0">And all around us wonder when they find</span>
<span class="i0">Such taste and strength, such skill and power combined;</span>
<span class="i0">There is no mother, Colin, no not one,</span>
<span class="i0">But envies me so kind, so good a son; <span class="linenum">450</span></span>
<span class="i0">By thee supported on this failing side,</span>
<span class="i0">Weakness itself awakes a parent’s pride;</span>
<span class="i0">I bless the stroke that was my grief before,</span>
<span class="i0">And feel such joy that ’tis disease no more;</span>
<span class="i0">Shielded by thee, my want becomes my wealth&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">And, soothed by Colin, sickness smiles at health;</span>
<span class="i0">The old men love thee, they repeat thy praise,</span>
<span class="i0">And say, like thee were youth in earlier days;</span>
<span class="i0">While every village-maiden cries, ’How gay,</span>
<span class="i0">How smart, how brave, how good is Colin Grey!’ <span class="linenum">460</span></span>
<span class="i2">“Yet art thou sad; alas! my son, I know</span>
<span class="i0">Thy heart is wounded, and the cure is slow;</span>
<span class="i0">Fain would I think that Jesse still may come</span>
<span class="i0">To share the comforts of our rustic home:</span>
<span class="i0">She surely loved thee; I have seen the maid,</span>
<span class="i0">When thou hast kindly brought the vicar aid&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">When thou hast eased his bosom of its pain,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Oh! I have seen her&mdash;she will come again.”</span>
<span class="i2">The matron ceased; and Colin stood the while</span>
<span class="i0">Silent, but striving for a grateful smile; <span class="linenum">470</span></span>
<span class="i0">He then replied&mdash;“Ah! sure, had Jesse stay’d,</span>
<span class="i0">And shared the comforts of our sylvan shade,</span>
<span class="i0">The tenderest duty and the fondest love</span>
<span class="i0">Would not have fail’d that generous heart to move;</span>
<span class="i0">A grateful pity would have ruled her breast,</span>
<span class="i0">And my distresses would have made me blest.</span>
<span class="i2">“But she is gone, and ever has in view<span class="ws11">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Grandeur and taste&mdash;and what will then ensue?<span class="ws6">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Surprise and then delight in scenes so fair and new; &emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">For many a day, perhaps for many a week, <span class="linenum">480</span></span>
<span class="i0">Home will have charms, and to her bosom speak;</span>
<span class="i0">But thoughtless ease, and affluence, and pride,</span>
<span class="i0">Seen day by day, will draw the heart aside:</span>
<span class="i0">And she at length, though gentle and sincere,</span>
<span class="i0">Will think no more of our enjoyments here.”</span>
<span class="i2">Sighing he spake&mdash;but hark! he hears th’ approach</span>
<span class="i0">Of rattling wheels! and lo! the evening-coach;</span>
<span class="i0">Once more the movement of the horses’ feet</span>
<span class="i0">Makes the fond heart with strong emotion beat;</span>
<span class="i0">Faint were his hopes, but ever had the sight <span class="linenum">490</span></span>
<span class="i0">Drawn him to gaze beside his gate at night;</span>
<span class="i0">And when with rapid wheels it hurried by,</span>
<span class="i0">He grieved his parent with a hopeless sigh;</span>
<span class="i0">And could the blessing have been bought&mdash;what sum</span>
<span class="i0">Had he not offer’d, to have Jesse come!</span>
<span class="i0">She came&mdash;he saw her bending from the door,</span>
<span class="i0">Her face, her smile, and he beheld no more;</span>
<span class="i0">Lost in his joy&mdash;the mother lent her aid</span>
<span class="i0">T’ assist and to detain the willing maid;</span>
<span class="i0">Who thought her late, her present home to make, <span class="linenum">500</span></span>
<span class="i0">Sure of a welcome for the vicar’s sake.</span>
<span class="i0">But the good parent was so pleased, so kind,</span>
<span class="i0">So pressing Colin, she so much inclined,</span>
<span class="i0">That night advanced; and then so long detain’d,<span class="ws9">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">No wishes to depart she felt, or feign’d; <span class="ws15">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Yet long in doubt she stood, and then perforce remain’d.&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i2">Here was a lover fond, a friend sincere;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Here was content and joy, for she was here:</span>
<span class="i0">In the mild evening, in the scene around,</span>
<span class="i0">The maid, now free, peculiar beauties found; <span class="linenum">510</span></span>
<span class="i0">Blended with village-tones, the evening-gale</span>
<span class="i0">Gave the sweet night-bird’s warblings to the vale;</span>
<span class="i0">The youth embolden’d, yet abash’d, now told</span>
<span class="i0">His fondest wish, nor found the maiden cold;</span>
<span class="i0">The mother smiling whisper’d&mdash;“Let him go</span>
<span class="i0">And seek the licence!” Jesse answer’d, “No:”</span>
<span class="i0">But Colin went, I know not if they live</span>
<span class="i0">With all the comforts wealth and plenty give;</span>
<span class="i0">But with pure joy to envious souls denied,</span>
<span class="i0">To suppliant meanness and suspicious pride; <span class="linenum">520</span></span>
<span class="i0">And village-maids of happy couples say,</span>
<span class="i0">“They live like Jesse Bourn and Colin Grey.”</span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A serious toyman in the city dwelt,</span>
<span class="i0">Who much concern for his religion felt;</span>
<span class="i0">Reading, he changed his tenets, read again,</span>
<span class="i0">And various questions could with skill maintain;</span>
<span class="i0">Papist and quaker if we set aside,</span>
<span class="i0">He had the road of every traveller tried;</span>
<span class="i0">There walk’d awhile, and on a sudden turn’d</span>
<span class="i0">Into some by-way he had just discern’d:</span>
<span class="i0">He had a nephew, Fulham&mdash;Fulham went</span>
<span class="i0">His uncle’s way, with every turn content; <span class="linenum">10</span></span>
<span class="i0">He saw his pious kinsman’s watchful care, <span class="ws12">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And thought such anxious pains his own might spare,<span class="ws4">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And he, the truth obtain’d, without the toil, might share.&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">In fact, young Fulham, though he little read,</span>
<span class="i0">Perceived his uncle was by fancy led;</span>
<span class="i0">And smiled to see the constant care he took,</span>
<span class="i0">Collating creed with creed, and book with book.</span>
<span class="i2">At length the senior fix’d; I pass the sect</span>
<span class="i0">He call’d a church, ’twas precious and elect;</span>
<span class="i0">Yet the seed fell not in the richest soil, <span class="linenum">20</span></span>
<span class="i0">For few disciples paid the preacher’s toil;</span>
<span class="i0">All in an attic-room were wont to meet,</span>
<span class="i0">These few disciples at their pastor’s feet;</span>
<span class="i0">With these went Fulham, who, discreet and grave,</span>
<span class="i0">Follow’d the light his worthy uncle gave;</span>
<span class="i0">Till a warm preacher found a way t’ impart</span>
<span class="i0">Awakening feelings to his torpid heart:</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Some weighty truths, and of unpleasant kind,</span>
<span class="i0">Sank, though resisted, in his struggling mind;</span>
<span class="i0">He wish’d to fly them, but, compell’d to stay, <span class="linenum">30</span></span>
<span class="i0">Truth to the waking Conscience found her way;</span>
<span class="i0">For though the youth was call’d a prudent lad,</span>
<span class="i0">And prudent was, yet serious faults he had;</span>
<span class="i0">Who now reflected&mdash;“Much am I surprised,</span>
<span class="i0">I find these notions cannot be despised;</span>
<span class="i0">No! there is something I perceive at last,</span>
<span class="i0">Although my uncle cannot hold it fast;</span>
<span class="i0">Though I the strictness of these men reject,</span>
<span class="i0">Yet I determine to be circumspect:</span>
<span class="i0">This man alarms me, and I must begin <span class="linenum">40</span></span>
<span class="i0">To look more closely to the things within;</span>
<span class="i0">These sons of zeal have I derided long,</span>
<span class="i0">But now begin to think the laughers wrong;</span>
<span class="i0">Nay, my good uncle, by all teachers moved,<span class="ws7">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Will be preferr’d to him who none approved:<span class="ws6">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Better to love amiss than nothing to have loved.”&nbsp;&emsp; }</span>
<span class="i2">Such were his thoughts, when Conscience first began</span>
<span class="i0">To hold close converse with th’ awaken’d man.</span>
<span class="i0">He from that time reserved and cautious grew,</span>
<span class="i0">And for his duties felt obedience due; <span class="linenum">50</span></span>
<span class="i0">Pious he was not, but he fear’d the pain</span>
<span class="i0">Of sins committed, nor would sin again.</span>
<span class="i0">Whene’er he stray’d, he found his Conscience rose,&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">Like one determined what was ill t’ oppose,<span class="ws8">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">What wrong t’ accuse, what secret to disclose;<span class="ws6">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">To drag forth every latent act to light,</span>
<span class="i0">And fix them fully in the actor’s sight:</span>
<span class="i0">This gave him trouble, but he still confess’d</span>
<span class="i0">The labour useful, for it brought him rest.</span>
<span class="i2">The uncle died, and when the nephew read <span class="linenum">60</span></span>
<span class="i0">The will, and saw the substance of the dead&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Five hundred guineas, with a stock in trade&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">He much rejoiced, and thought his fortune made;</span>
<span class="i0">Yet felt aspiring pleasure at the sight,</span>
<span class="i0">And, for increase, increasing appetite.</span>
<span class="i0">Desire of profit idle habits check’d,</span>
<span class="i0">(For Fulham’s virtue was to be correct);</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
<span class="i0">He and his Conscience had their compact made&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“Urge me with truth, and you will soon persuade;</span>
<span class="i0">But not,” he cried, “for mere ideal things <span class="linenum">70</span></span>
<span class="i0">Give me to feel those terror-breeding stings.”</span>
<span class="i2">“Let not such thoughts,” she said, “your mind confound;</span>
<span class="i0">Trifles may wake me, but they never wound;</span>
<span class="i0">In them indeed there is a wrong and right,</span>
<span class="i0">But you will find me pliant and polite;</span>
<span class="i0">Not like a Conscience of the dotard kind,</span>
<span class="i0">Awake to dreams, to dire offences blind.</span>
<span class="i0">Let all within be pure; in all beside</span>
<span class="i0">Be your own master, governor, and guide;</span>
<span class="i0">Alive to danger, in temptation strong&mdash; <span class="linenum">80</span></span>
<span class="i0">And I shall sleep our whole existence long.”</span>
<span class="i2">“Sweet be thy sleep,” said Fulham; “strong must be</span>
<span class="i0">The tempting ill that gains access to me;</span>
<span class="i0">Never will I to evil deed consent,</span>
<span class="i0">Or, if surprised, oh! how will I repent!</span>
<span class="i0">Should gain be doubtful, soon would I restore</span>
<span class="i0">The dangerous good, or give it to the poor;</span>
<span class="i0">Repose for them my growing wealth shall buy&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Or build&mdash;who knows?&mdash;an hospital like Guy.&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Yet why such means to soothe the smart within, <span class="linenum">90</span></span>
<span class="i0">While firmly purposed to renounce the sin?”</span>
<span class="i2">Thus our young Trader and his Conscience dwelt</span>
<span class="i0">In mutual love, and great the joy they felt;</span>
<span class="i0">But yet in small concerns, in trivial things,</span>
<span class="i0">“She was,” he said, “too ready with the stings;”</span>
<span class="i0">And he too apt, in search of growing gains,</span>
<span class="i0">To lose the fear of penalties and pains:</span>
<span class="i0">Yet these were trifling bickerings, petty jars,</span>
<span class="i0">Domestic strifes, preliminary wars;</span>
<span class="i0">He ventured little, little she express’d <span class="linenum">100</span></span>
<span class="i0">Of indignation, and they both had rest.</span>
<span class="i2">Thus was he fix’d to walk the worthy way,</span>
<span class="i0">When profit urged him to a bold essay.&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">A time was that when all at pleasure gamed</span>
<span class="i0">In lottery-chances, yet of law unblamed;</span>
<span class="i0">This Fulham tried: who would to him advance</span>
<span class="i0">A pound or crown, he gave in turn a chance</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
<span class="i0">For weighty prize&mdash;and should they nothing share,</span>
<span class="i0">They had their crown or pound in Fulham’s ware;</span>
<span class="i0">Thus the old stores within the shop were sold <span class="linenum">110</span></span>
<span class="i0">For that which none refuses, new or old.</span>
<span class="i2">Was this unjust? Yet Conscience could not rest</span>
<span class="i0">But made a mighty struggle in the breast;</span>
<span class="i0">And gave th’ aspiring man an early proof,</span>
<span class="i0">That should they war he would have work enough:</span>
<span class="i0">“Suppose,” said she, “your vended numbers rise</span>
<span class="i0">The same with those which gain each real prize,</span>
<span class="i0">(Such your proposal,) can you ruin shun?”</span>
<span class="i0">“A hundred thousand,” he replied, “to one.”&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“Still it may happen.”&mdash;“I the sum must pay.”&mdash; <span class="linenum">120</span></span>
<span class="i0">“You know you cannot.”&mdash;“I can run away.”&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“That is dishonest.”&mdash;“Nay, but you must wink</span>
<span class="i0">At a chance-hit; it cannot be, I think.</span>
<span class="i0">Upon my conduct as a whole decide,</span>
<span class="i0">Such trifling errors let my virtues hide;</span>
<span class="i0">Fail I at meeting? am I sleepy there?</span>
<span class="i0">My purse refuse I with the priest to share?</span>
<span class="i0">Do I deny the poor a helping hand?</span>
<span class="i0">Or stop the wicked women in the Strand?</span>
<span class="i0">Or drink at club beyond a certain pitch? <span class="linenum">130</span></span>
<span class="i0">Which are your charges? Conscience, tell me which.”</span>
<span class="i2">“’Tis well,” said she, “but&mdash;” “Nay, I pray, have done:</span>
<span class="i0">Trust me, I will not into danger run.”</span>
<span class="i2">The lottery drawn, not one demand was made;</span>
<span class="i0">Fulham gain’d profit and increase of trade.</span>
<span class="i0">“See now,” said he&mdash;for Conscience yet arose&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“How foolish ’tis such measures to oppose:</span>
<span class="i0">Have I not blameless thus my state advanced?”&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“Still,” mutter’d Conscience, “still it might have chanced.”&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“Might!” said our hero, “who is so exact <span class="linenum">140</span></span>
<span class="i0">As to inquire what might have been a fact?”</span>
<span class="i2">Now Fulham’s shop contain’d a curious view</span>
<span class="i0">Of costly trifles, elegant and new:</span>
<span class="i0">The papers told where kind mammas might buy</span>
<span class="i0">The gayest toys to charm an infant’s eye;</span>
<span class="i0">Where generous beaux might gentle damsels please,</span>
<span class="i0">And travellers call who cross the land or seas,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And find the curious art, the neat device,</span>
<span class="i0">Of precious value and of trifling price.</span>
<span class="i2">Here Conscience rested: she was pleased to find <span class="linenum">150</span></span>
<span class="i0">No less an active than an honest mind;</span>
<span class="i0">But, when he named his price, and when he swore,</span>
<span class="i0">His Conscience check’d him, that he ask’d no more&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">When half he sought had been a large increase</span>
<span class="i0">On fair demand&mdash;she could not rest in peace</span>
<span class="i0">(Beside th’ affront to call th’ adviser in,</span>
<span class="i0">Who would prevent, to justify the sin.)</span>
<span class="i0">She therefore told him, that “he vainly tried</span>
<span class="i0">To soothe her anger, conscious that he lied;</span>
<span class="i0">If thus he grasp’d at such usurious gains, <span class="linenum">160</span></span>
<span class="i0">He must deserve, and should expect, her pains.”</span>
<span class="i2">The charge was strong; he would in part confess</span>
<span class="i0">Offence there was&mdash;but, who offended less?</span>
<span class="i0">“What! is a mere assertion call’d a lie?</span>
<span class="i0">And if it be, are men compell’d to buy?</span>
<span class="i0">’Twas strange that Conscience on such points should dwell,&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">While he was acting (he would call it) well;<span class="ws15">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">He bought as others buy, he sold as others sell: <span class="ws12">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">There was no fraud, and he demanded cause</span>
<span class="i0">Why he was troubled, when he kept the laws?” <span class="linenum">170</span></span>
<span class="i2">“My laws?” said Conscience: “What,” said he, “are thine?</span>
<span class="i0">Oral or written, human or divine?</span>
<span class="i0">Show me the chapter, let me see the text;</span>
<span class="i0">By laws uncertain subjects are perplex’d;</span>
<span class="i0">Let me my finger on the statute lay,</span>
<span class="i0">And I shall feel it duty to obey.”</span>
<span class="i2">“Reflect,” said Conscience, “’twas your own desire</span>
<span class="i0">That I should warn you&mdash;does the compact tire?</span>
<span class="i0">Repent you this? then bid me not advise,</span>
<span class="i0">And rather hear your passions as they rise; <span class="linenum">180</span></span>
<span class="i0">So you may counsel and remonstrance shun,</span>
<span class="i0">But then remember it is war begun;</span>
<span class="i0">And you may judge from some attacks, my friend,</span>
<span class="i0">What serious conflicts will on war attend.”</span>
<span class="i2">“Nay, but,” at length the thoughtful man replied,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
<span class="i0">“I say not that; I wish you for my guide;</span>
<span class="i0">Wish for your checks and your reproofs&mdash;but then</span>
<span class="i0">Be like a Conscience of my fellow-men;</span>
<span class="i0">Worthy I mean, and men of good report,</span>
<span class="i0">And not the wretches who with conscience sport. <span class="linenum">190</span></span>
<span class="i0">There’s Bice, my friend, who passes off his grease</span>
<span class="i0">Of pigs for bears’, in pots a crown apiece;</span>
<span class="i0">His Conscience never checks him when he swears</span>
<span class="i0">The fat he sells is honest fat of bears;</span>
<span class="i0">And so it is, for he contrives to give</span>
<span class="i0">A drachm to each&mdash;’tis thus that tradesmen live:</span>
<span class="i0">Now why should you and I be over-nice;</span>
<span class="i0">What man is held in more repute than Bice?”</span>
<span class="i2">Here ended the dispute; but yet ’twas plain</span>
<span class="i0">The parties both expected strife again. <span class="linenum">200</span></span>
<span class="i0">Their friendship cool’d, he look’d about and saw</span>
<span class="i0">Numbers who seem’d unshackled by his awe;</span>
<span class="i0">While like a school-boy he was threaten’d still,</span>
<span class="i0">Now for the deed, now only for the will;</span>
<span class="i0">Here Conscience answer’d, “To thy neighbour’s guide</span>
<span class="i0">Thy neighbour leave, and in thine own confide.”</span>
<span class="i2">Such were each day the charges and replies,</span>
<span class="i0">When a new object caught the trader’s eyes;</span>
<span class="i0">A vestry-patriot, could he gain the name,</span>
<span class="i0">Would famous make him, and would pay the fame. <span class="linenum">210</span></span>
<span class="i0">He knew full well the sums bequeath’d in charge</span>
<span class="i0">For schools, for alms-men, for the poor, were large;</span>
<span class="i0">Report had told, and he could feel it true,</span>
<span class="i0">That most unfairly dealt the trusted few;</span>
<span class="i0">No partners would they in their office take,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor clear accounts at annual meetings make;</span>
<span class="i0">Aloud our hero in the vestry spoke</span>
<span class="i0">Of hidden deeds, and vow’d to draw the cloak;</span>
<span class="i0">It was the poor man’s cause, and he for one</span>
<span class="i0">Was quite determined to see justice done. <span class="linenum">220</span></span>
<span class="i0">His foes affected laughter, then disdain,<span class="ws13">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">They too were loud and threat’ning, but in vain; <span class="ws6">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">The pauper’s friend, their foe, arose and spoke again. &emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">Fiercely he cried, “Your garbled statements show</span>
<span class="i0">That you determine we shall nothing know;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But we shall bring your hidden crimes to light,</span>
<span class="i0">Give you to shame, and to the poor their right.”</span>
<span class="i2">Virtue like this might some approval ask&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">But Conscience sternly said, “You wear a mask!”</span>
<span class="i0">“At least,” said Fulham, “if I have a view <span class="linenum">230</span></span>
<span class="i0">To serve myself, I serve the public too.”</span>
<span class="i2">Fulham, though check’d, retain’d his former zeal,</span>
<span class="i0">And this the cautious rogues began to feel.</span>
<span class="i0">“Thus will he ever bark,” in peevish tone</span>
<span class="i0">An elder cried&mdash;“the cur must have a bone.”</span>
<span class="i0">They then began to hint&mdash;and to begin</span>
<span class="i0">Was all they needed: it was felt within;</span>
<span class="i0">In terms less veil’d an offer then was made,</span>
<span class="i0">Though distant still, it fail’d not to persuade;</span>
<span class="i0">More plainly then was every point proposed, <span class="linenum">240</span></span>
<span class="i0">Approved, accepted, and the bargain closed.</span>
<span class="i0">“Th’ exulting paupers hail’d their friend’s success,</span>
<span class="i0">And bade adieu to murmurs and distress.”</span>
<span class="i2">Alas! their friend had now superior light,</span>
<span class="i0">And, view’d by that, he found that all was right;</span>
<span class="i0">“There were no errors, the disbursements small;</span>
<span class="i0">This was the truth, and truth was due to all.”</span>
<span class="i2">And rested Conscience? No! she would not rest,</span>
<span class="i0">Yet was content with making a protest.</span>
<span class="i0">Some acts she now with less resistance bore, <span class="linenum">250</span></span>
<span class="i0">Nor took alarm so quickly as before;</span>
<span class="i0">Like those in towns besieged, who every ball</span>
<span class="i0">At first with terror view, and dread them all;</span>
<span class="i0">But, grown familiar with the scenes, they fear</span>
<span class="i0">The danger less, as it approaches near:</span>
<span class="i0">So Conscience, more familiar with the view</span>
<span class="i0">Of growing evils, less attentive grew;</span>
<span class="i0">Yet he who felt some pain, and dreaded more,</span>
<span class="i0">Gave a peace-offering to the angry poor.</span>
<span class="i2">Thus had he quiet&mdash;but the time was brief, <span class="linenum">260</span></span>
<span class="i0">From his new triumph sprang a cause of grief;</span>
<span class="i0">In office join’d, and acting with the rest,</span>
<span class="i0">He must admit the sacramental test.</span>
<span class="i0">Now, as a sectary, who had all his life,</span>
<span class="i0">As he supposed, been with the church at strife</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
<span class="i0">(No rules of hers, no laws had he perused,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor knew the tenets he by rote abused);</span>
<span class="i0">Yet Conscience here arose more fierce and strong,</span>
<span class="i0">Than when she told of robbery and wrong;</span>
<span class="i0">“Change his religion! No! he must be sure <span class="linenum">270</span></span>
<span class="i0">That was a blow no conscience could endure.”</span>
<span class="i2">Though friend to virtue, yet she oft abides</span>
<span class="i0">In early notions, fix’d by erring guides,</span>
<span class="i0">And is more startled by a call from those,</span>
<span class="i0">Than when the foulest crimes her rest oppose;</span>
<span class="i0">By error taught, by prejudice misled,</span>
<span class="i0">She yields her rights, and fancy rules instead;</span>
<span class="i0">When Conscience all her stings and terror deals,</span>
<span class="i0">Not as truth dictates, but as fancy feels;</span>
<span class="i0">And thus within our hero’s troubled breast, <span class="linenum">280</span></span>
<span class="i0">Crime was less torture than the odious test.</span>
<span class="i0">New forms, new measures, he must now embrace,</span>
<span class="i0">With sad conviction that they warr’d with grace;</span>
<span class="i0">To his new church no former friend would come,</span>
<span class="i0">They scarce preferr’d her to the church of Rome.</span>
<span class="i0">But, thinking much, and weighing guilt and gain,</span>
<span class="i0">Conscience and he commuted for her pain;</span>
<span class="i0">Then promised Fulham to retain his creed,</span>
<span class="i0">And their peculiar paupers still to feed;</span>
<span class="i0">Their attic-room (in secret) to attend, <span class="linenum">290</span></span>
<span class="i0">And not forget he was the preacher’s friend;</span>
<span class="i0">Thus he proposed, and Conscience, troubled, tried,</span>
<span class="i0">And wanting peace, reluctantly complied.</span>
<span class="i2">Now care subdued, and apprehensions gone,</span>
<span class="i0">In peace our hero went aspiring on;</span>
<span class="i0">But short the period&mdash;soon a quarrel rose,</span>
<span class="i0">Fierce in the birth, and fatal in the close;</span>
<span class="i0">With times of truce between, which rather proved</span>
<span class="i0">That both were weary, than that either loved.</span>
<span class="i2">Fulham ev’n now disliked the heavy thrall,<span class="ws12">}</span><span class="linenum">300</span></span>
<span class="i0">And for her death would in his anguish call,<span class="ws13">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">As Rome’s mistaken friend exclaim’d, <i>Let Carthage fall</i>! &emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">So felt our hero, so his wish express’d,</span>
<span class="i0">Against this powerful sprite&mdash;<i>delenda est</i>.</span>
<span class="i0">Rome in her conquest saw not danger near,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Freed from her rival, and without a fear;</span>
<span class="i0">So, Conscience conquer’d, men perceive how free,</span>
<span class="i0">But not how fatal, such a state must be.</span>
<span class="i0">Fatal, not free, our hero’s: foe or friend,</span>
<span class="i0">Conscience on him was destined to attend; <span class="linenum">310</span></span>
<span class="i0">She [dozed] indeed, grew dull, nor seem’d to spy</span>
<span class="i0">Crime following crime, and each of deeper dye;</span>
<span class="i0">But all were noticed, and the reckoning time</span>
<span class="i0">With her account came on&mdash;crime following crime.</span>
<span class="i2">This, once a foe, now brother in the trust,</span>
<span class="i0">Whom Fulham late described as fair and just,</span>
<span class="i0">Was the sole guardian of a wealthy maid,</span>
<span class="i0">Placed in his power, and of his frown afraid:</span>
<span class="i0">Not quite an idiot, for her busy brain</span>
<span class="i0">Sought, by poor cunning, trifling points to gain; <span class="linenum">320</span></span>
<span class="i0">Success in childish projects her delight,</span>
<span class="i0">She took no heed of each important right.</span>
<span class="i2">The friendly parties met&mdash;the guardian cried,</span>
<span class="i0">“I am too old; my sons have each a bride:</span>
<span class="i0">Martha, my ward, would make an easy wife;</span>
<span class="i0">On easy terms I’ll make her yours for life;</span>
<span class="i0">And then the creature is so weak and mild,</span>
<span class="i0">She may be soothed and threaten’d as a child&mdash;”</span>
<span class="i0">“Yet not obey,” said Fulham, “for your fools,</span>
<span class="i0">Female and male, are obstinate as mules.” <span class="linenum">330</span></span>
<span class="i2">Some points adjusted, these new friends agreed,</span>
<span class="i0">Proposed the day, and hurried on the deed.</span>
<span class="i2">“’Tis a vile act,” said Conscience;&mdash;“It will prove,”</span>
<span class="i0">Replied the bolder man, “an act of love;</span>
<span class="i0">Her wicked guardian might the girl have sold</span>
<span class="i0">To endless misery for a tyrant’s gold;</span>
<span class="i0">Now may her life be happy&mdash;for I mean</span>
<span class="i0">To keep my temper even and serene.”</span>
<span class="i0">“I cannot thus compound,” the spirit cried,</span>
<span class="i0">“Nor have my laws thus broken and defied; <span class="linenum">340</span></span>
<span class="i0">This is a fraud, a bargain for a wife;</span>
<span class="i0">Expect my vengeance, or amend your life.”</span>
<span class="i2">The wife was pretty, trifling, childish, weak;</span>
<span class="i0">She could not think, but would not cease to speak.</span>
<span class="i0">This he forbad&mdash;she took the caution ill,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And boldly rose against his sovereign will;</span>
<span class="i0">With idiot-cunning she would watch the hour,</span>
<span class="i0">When friends were present, to dispute his power:</span>
<span class="i0">With tyrant-craft, he then was still and calm,</span>
<span class="i0">But raised in private terror and alarm: <span class="linenum">350</span></span>
<span class="i0">By many trials, she perceived how far</span>
<span class="i0">To vex and tease, without an open war;</span>
<span class="i0">And he discover’d that so weak a mind</span>
<span class="i0">No art could lead, and no compulsion bind;</span>
<span class="i0">The rudest force would fail such mind to tame,</span>
<span class="i0">And she was callous to rebuke and shame;</span>
<span class="i0">Proud of her wealth, the power of law she knew,</span>
<span class="i0">And would assist him in the spending too.</span>
<span class="i0">His threat’ning words with insult she defied,</span>
<span class="i0">To all his reasoning with a stare replied; <span class="linenum">360</span></span>
<span class="i0">And when he begg’d her to attend, would say,</span>
<span class="i0">“Attend I will&mdash;but let me have my way.”</span>
<span class="i2">Nor rest had Conscience: “While you merit pain</span>
<span class="i0">From me,” she cried, “you seek redress in vain.”</span>
<span class="i0">His thoughts were grievous: “All that I possess</span>
<span class="i0">From this vile bargain adds to my distress;</span>
<span class="i0">To pass a life with one who will not mend,<span class="ws4">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Who cannot love, nor save, nor wisely spend,&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">Is a vile prospect, and I see no end;<span class="ws10">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">For if we part, I must of course restore <span class="linenum">370</span></span>
<span class="i0">Much of her money, and must wed no more.</span>
<span class="i2">“Is there no way?”&mdash;here Conscience rose in power,</span>
<span class="i0">“Oh! fly the danger of this fatal hour;</span>
<span class="i0">I am thy Conscience, faithful, fond, and true,</span>
<span class="i0">Ah, fly this thought, or evil must ensue;</span>
<span class="i0">Fall on thy knees, and pray with all thy soul,</span>
<span class="i0">Thy purpose banish, thy design control;</span>
<span class="i0">Let every hope of such advantage cease,</span>
<span class="i0">Or never more expect a moment’s peace.”</span>
<span class="i2">Th’ affrighten’d man a due attention paid, <span class="linenum">380</span></span>
<span class="i0">Felt the rebuke, and the command obey’d.</span>
<span class="i2">Again the wife rebell’d, again express’d</span>
<span class="i0">A love for pleasure&mdash;a contempt of rest;</span>
<span class="i0">“She, whom she pleased, would visit, would receive</span>
<span class="i0">Those who pleased her, nor deign to ask for leave.”</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
<span class="i2">“One way there is,” said he; “I might contrive</span>
<span class="i0">Into a trap this foolish thing to drive:</span>
<span class="i0">Who pleased her, said she?&mdash;I’ll be certain who&mdash;”</span>
<span class="i0">“Take heed,” said Conscience, “what thou mean’st to do:</span>
<span class="i0">Ensnare thy wife?”&mdash;“Why yes,” he must confess, <span class="linenum">390</span></span>
<span class="i0">“It might be wrong&mdash;but there was no redress;</span>
<span class="i0">Beside, to think,” said he, “is not to sin.”</span>
<span class="i0">“Mistaken man!” replied the power within.</span>
<span class="i0">No guest unnoticed to the lady came,</span>
<span class="i0">He judged th’ event with mingled joy and shame;</span>
<span class="i0">Oft he withdrew, and seem’d to leave her free.</span>
<span class="i0">But still as watchful as a lynx was he;</span>
<span class="i0">Meanwhile the wife was thoughtless, cool, and gay,</span>
<span class="i0">And, without virtue, had no wish to stray.</span>
<span class="i2">Though thus opposed, his plans were not resign’d; <span class="linenum">400</span></span>
<span class="i0">“Revenge,” said he, “will prompt that daring mind;</span>
<span class="i0">Refused supplies, insulted and distress’d,</span>
<span class="i0">Enraged with me, and near a favourite guest&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Then will her vengeance prompt the daring deed,</span>
<span class="i0">And I shall watch, detect her, and be freed.”</span>
<span class="i2">There was a youth&mdash;but let me hide the name,</span>
<span class="i0">With all the progress of this deed of shame;</span>
<span class="i0">He had his views&mdash;on him the husband cast</span>
<span class="i0">His net, and saw him in his trammels fast.</span>
<span class="i2">“Pause but a moment&mdash;think what you intend,” <span class="linenum">410</span></span>
<span class="i0">Said the roused sleeper; “I am yet a friend;</span>
<span class="i0">Must all our days in enmity be spent?”</span>
<span class="i0">“No!” and he paused&mdash;“I surely shall repent:”</span>
<span class="i0">Then hurried on&mdash;the evil plan was laid,<span class="ws14">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">The wife was guilty, and her friend betray’d, <span class="ws10">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And Fulham gain’d his wish, and for his will was paid. &emsp;}</span>
<span class="i2">Had crimes less weighty on the spirit press’d,</span>
<span class="i0">This troubled Conscience might have sunk to rest;</span>
<span class="i0">And, like a foolish guard, been bribed to peace,</span>
<span class="i0">By a false promise, that offence should cease; <span class="linenum">420</span></span>
<span class="i0">Past faults had seem’d familiar to the view,</span>
<span class="i0">Confused if many, and obscure though true;</span>
<span class="i0">And Conscience, troubled with the dull account,</span>
<span class="i0">Had dropp’d her tale, and slumber’d o’er th’ amount.</span>
<span class="i0">But, struck by daring guilt, alert she rose,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Disturbed, alarm’d, and could no more repose;</span>
<span class="i0">All hopes of friendship, and of peace, were past,</span>
<span class="i0">And every view with gloom was overcast.</span>
<span class="i0">Hence from that day, that day of shame and sin,</span>
<span class="i0">Arose the restless enmity within; <span class="linenum">430</span></span>
<span class="i0">On no resource could Fulham now rely,</span>
<span class="i0">Doom’d all expedients, and in vain, to try;</span>
<span class="i0">For Conscience, roused, sat boldly on her throne,<span class="ws8">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Watch’d every thought, attack’d the foe alone,<span class="ws10">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And with envenom’d sting drew forth the inward groan: &emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">Expedients fail’d that brought relief before, <span class="ws10">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">In vain his alms gave comfort to the poor: <span class="ws11">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Give what he would, to him the comfort came no more.&nbsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">Not prayer avail’d, and when (his crimes confess’d)</span>
<span class="i0">He felt some ease, she said&mdash;“are they redress’d? <span class="linenum">440</span></span>
<span class="i0">You still retain the profit, and be sure,</span>
<span class="i0">Long as it lasts, this anguish shall endure.”</span>
<span class="i2">Fulham still tried to soothe her, cheat, mislead;<span class="ws9">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">But Conscience laid her finger on the deed,<span class="ws14">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And read the crime with power, and all that must succeed.&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">He tried t’ expel her, but was sure to find</span>
<span class="i0">Her strength increased by all that he design’d;</span>
<span class="i0">Nor ever was his groan more loud and deep,</span>
<span class="i0">Than when refresh’d she rose from momentary sleep.</span>
<span class="i2">Now desperate grown, weak, harass’d, and afraid, <span class="linenum">450</span></span>
<span class="i0">From new allies he sought for doubtful aid;</span>
<span class="i0">To thought itself he strove to bid adieu,</span>
<span class="i0">And from devotions to diversions flew;</span>
<span class="i0">He took a poor domestic for a slave,</span>
<span class="i0">(Though Avarice grieved to see the price he gave);</span>
<span class="i0">Upon his board, once frugal, press’d a load</span>
<span class="i0">Of viands rich, the appetite to goad;</span>
<span class="i0">The long-protracted meal, the sparkling cup,</span>
<span class="i0">Fought with his gloom, and kept his courage up;</span>
<span class="i0">Soon as the morning came, there met his eyes <span class="linenum">460</span></span>
<span class="i0">Accounts of wealth, that he might reading rise;</span>
<span class="i0">To profit then he gave some active hours,</span>
<span class="i0">Till food and wine again should renovate his powers.</span>
<span class="i0">Yet, spite of all defence, of every aid,</span>
<span class="i0">The watchful foe her close attention paid;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
<span class="i0">In every thoughtful moment, on she press’d,</span>
<span class="i0">And gave at once her dagger to his breast;</span>
<span class="i0">He waked at midnight, and the fears of sin,</span>
<span class="i0">As waters through a bursten dam, broke in;</span>
<span class="i0">Nay, in the banquet, with his friends around, <span class="linenum">470</span></span>
<span class="i0">When all their cares and half their crimes were drown’d,</span>
<span class="i0">Would some chance act awake the slumbering fear,</span>
<span class="i0">And care and crime in all their strength appear:</span>
<span class="i0">The news is read, a guilty victim swings,</span>
<span class="i0">And troubled looks proclaim the bosom-stings;</span>
<span class="i0">Some pair are wed; this brings the wife in view,</span>
<span class="i0">And some divorced: this shows the parting too;</span>
<span class="i0">Nor can he hear of evil word or deed,</span>
<span class="i0">But they to thought, and thought to sufferings lead.</span>
<span class="i2">Such was his life&mdash;no other changes came, <span class="linenum">480</span></span>
<span class="i0">The hurrying day, the conscious night the same;</span>
<span class="i0">The night of horror&mdash;when he, starting, cried</span>
<span class="i0">To the poor startled sinner at his side:</span>
<span class="i0">“Is it in law? am I condemn’d to die?</span>
<span class="i0">Let me escape!&mdash;I’ll give&mdash;oh! let me fly&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">How! but a dream&mdash;no judges! dungeon! chain!</span>
<span class="i0">Or these grim men!&mdash;I will not sleep again.&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Wilt thou, dread being! thus thy promise keep?</span>
<span class="i0">Day is thy time&mdash;and wilt thou murder sleep?</span>
<span class="i0">Sorrow and want repose, and wilt thou come, <span class="linenum">490</span></span>
<span class="i0">Nor give one hour of pure untroubled gloom?</span>
<span class="i2">“Oh! Conscience! Conscience! man’s most faithful friend,</span>
<span class="i0">Him canst thou comfort, ease, relieve, defend;</span>
<span class="i0">But if he will thy friendly checks forego,</span>
<span class="i0">Thou art, oh! woe for me, his deadliest foe!”</span>

<p class="f110"><i>THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST.</i></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A wealthy lord of far-extended land</span>
<span class="i0">Had all that pleased him placed at his command;</span>
<span class="i0">Widow’d of late, but finding much relief</span>
<span class="i0">In the world’s comforts, he dismiss’d his grief;</span>
<span class="i0">He was by marriage of his daughters eased,</span>
<span class="i0">And knew his sons could marry if they pleased;</span>
<span class="i0">Meantime in travel he indulged the boys,</span>
<span class="i0">And kept no spy nor partner of his joys.</span>
<span class="i2">These joys, indeed, were of the grosser kind,</span>
<span class="i0">That fed the cravings of an earthly mind; <span class="linenum">10</span></span>
<span class="i0">A mind that, conscious of its own excess,</span>
<span class="i0">Felt the reproach his neighbours would express.</span>
<span class="i0">Long at th’ indulgent board he loved to sit,</span>
<span class="i0">Where joy was laughter, and profaneness wit;</span>
<span class="i0">And such the guest and manners of the hall,</span>
<span class="i0">No wedded lady on the ’squire would call.</span>
<span class="i0">Here reign’d a favourite, and her triumph gain’d</span>
<span class="i0">O’er other favourites who before had reign’d;</span>
<span class="i0">Reserved and modest seem’d the nymph to be,</span>
<span class="i0">Knowing her lord was charm’d with modesty; <span class="linenum">20</span></span>
<span class="i0">For he, a sportsman keen, the more enjoy’d,</span>
<span class="i0">The greater value had the thing destroy’d.</span>
<span class="i2">Our ’squire declared, that, from a wife released,</span>
<span class="i0">He would no more give trouble to a priest;</span>
<span class="i0">Seem’d it not, then, ungrateful and unkind,</span>
<span class="i0">That he should trouble from the priesthood find?</span>
<span class="i0">The church he honour’d, and he gave the due</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And full respect to every son he knew;</span>
<span class="i0">But envied those who had the luck to meet</span>
<span class="i0">A gentle pastor, civil, and discreet; <span class="linenum">30</span></span>
<span class="i0">Who never bold and hostile sermon penn’d,</span>
<span class="i0">To wound a sinner, or to shame a friend;</span>
<span class="i0">One whom no being either shunn’d or fear’d,</span>
<span class="i0">Such must be loved wherever they appear’d.</span>
<span class="i2">Not such the stern old rector of the time,</span>
<span class="i0">Who soothed no culprit, and who spared no crime;</span>
<span class="i0">Who would his fears and his contempt express,</span>
<span class="i0">For irreligion and licentiousness;</span>
<span class="i0">Of him our village lord, his guests among,</span>
<span class="i0">By speech vindictive proved his feelings stung. <span class="linenum">40</span></span>
<span class="i2">“Were he a bigot,” said the ’squire, “whose zeal</span>
<span class="i0">Condemn’d us all, I should disdain to feel:</span>
<span class="i0">But when a man of parts, in college train’d,</span>
<span class="i0">Prates of our conduct&mdash;who would not be pain’d,</span>
<span class="i0">While he declaims (where no one dares reply)<span class="ws6">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">On men abandon’d, grov’ling in the sty <span class="ws11">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">(Like beasts in human shape) of shameless luxury?&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">Yet with a patriot’s zeal I stand the shock</span>
<span class="i0">Of vile rebuke, example to his flock;</span>
<span class="i0">But let this rector, thus severe and proud, <span class="linenum">50</span></span>
<span class="i0">Change his wide surplice for a narrow shroud,</span>
<span class="i0">And I will place within his seat a youth,</span>
<span class="i0">Train’d by the Graces, to explain the truth;</span>
<span class="i0">Then shall the flock with gentle hand be led,</span>
<span class="i0">By wisdom won, and by compassion fed.”</span>
<span class="i2">This purposed teacher was a sister’s son,</span>
<span class="i0">Who of her children gave the priesthood one;</span>
<span class="i0">And she had early train’d for this employ</span>
<span class="i0">The pliant talents of her college-boy.</span>
<span class="i0">At various times her letters painted all <span class="linenum">60</span></span>
<span class="i0">Her brother’s views&mdash;the manners of the hall;</span>
<span class="i0">The rector’s harshness, and the mischief made</span>
<span class="i0">By chiding those whom preachers should persuade:</span>
<span class="i0">This led the youth to views of easy life,</span>
<span class="i0">A friendly patron, an obliging wife;</span>
<span class="i0">His tithe, his glebe, the garden and the steed,</span>
<span class="i0">With books as many as he wish’d to read.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
<span class="i2">All this accorded with the uncle’s will;</span>
<span class="i0">He loved a priest compliant, easy, still;</span>
<span class="i0">Sums he had often to his favourite sent, <span class="linenum">70</span></span>
<span class="i0">“To be,” he wrote, “in manly freedom spent;</span>
<span class="i0">For well it pleased his spirit to assist</span>
<span class="i0">An honest lad, who scorn’d a Methodist.”</span>
<span class="i0">His mother too, in her maternal care,</span>
<span class="i0">Bade him of canting hypocrites beware;</span>
<span class="i0">Who from his duties would his heart seduce,</span>
<span class="i0">And make his talents of no earthly use.</span>
<span class="i2">Soon must a trial of his worth be made&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">The ancient priest is to the tomb convey’d;</span>
<span class="i0">And the youth summon’d from a serious friend, <span class="linenum">80</span></span>
<span class="i0">His guide and host, new duties to attend.</span>
<span class="i2">Three months before, the nephew and the ’squire</span>
<span class="i0">Saw mutual worth to praise and to admire;</span>
<span class="i0">And though the one too early left his wine,</span>
<span class="i0">The other still exclaim’d&mdash;“My boy will shine:</span>
<span class="i0">Yes, I perceive that he will soon improve,</span>
<span class="i0">And I shall form the very guide I love;</span>
<span class="i0">Decent abroad, he will my name defend,</span>
<span class="i0">And, when at home, be social and unbend.”</span>
<span class="i2">The plan was specious, for the mind of James <span class="linenum">90</span></span>
<span class="i0">Accorded duly with his uncle’s schemes:</span>
<span class="i0">He then aspired not to a higher name</span>
<span class="i0">Than sober clerks of moderate talents claim;</span>
<span class="i0">Gravely to pray, and rev’rendly to preach,</span>
<span class="i0">Was all he saw, good youth! within his reach.</span>
<span class="i0">Thus may a mass of sulphur long abide,</span>
<span class="i0">Cold and inert, but, to the flame applied,</span>
<span class="i0">Kindling it blazes, and consuming turns</span>
<span class="i0">To smoke and poison, as it boils and burns.</span>
<span class="i2">James, leaving college, to a preacher stray’d; <span class="linenum">100</span></span>
<span class="i0">What call’d, he knew not&mdash;but the call obey’d,</span>
<span class="i0">Mild, idle, pensive, ever led by those</span>
<span class="i0">Who could some specious novelty propose;</span>
<span class="i0">Humbly he listen’d, while the preacher dwelt</span>
<span class="i0">On touching themes, and strong emotions felt;</span>
<span class="i0">And in this night was fix’d that pliant will</span>
<span class="i0">To one sole point, and he retains it still.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
<span class="i2">At first his care was to himself confined;</span>
<span class="i0">Himself assured, he gave it to mankind:</span>
<span class="i0">His zeal grew active&mdash;honest, earnest zeal, <span class="linenum">110</span></span>
<span class="i0">And comfort dealt to him, he long’d to deal;</span>
<span class="i0">He to his favourite preacher now withdrew,</span>
<span class="i0">Was taught to teach, instructed to subdue;</span>
<span class="i0">And train’d for ghostly warfare, when the call</span>
<span class="i0">Of his new duties reach’d him from the hall.</span>
<span class="i2">Now to the ’squire, although alert and stout,</span>
<span class="i0">Came unexpected an attack of gout;</span>
<span class="i0">And the grieved patron felt such serious pain,</span>
<span class="i0">He never thought to see a church again.</span>
<span class="i0">Thrice had the youthful rector taught the crowd, <span class="linenum">120</span></span>
<span class="i0">Whose growing numbers spoke his powers aloud,</span>
<span class="i0">Before the patron could himself rejoice</span>
<span class="i0">(His pain still lingering) in the general voice;</span>
<span class="i0">For he imputed all this early fame</span>
<span class="i0">To graceful manner, and the well-known name;</span>
<span class="i0">And to himself assumed a share of praise,</span>
<span class="i0">For worth and talents he was pleased to raise.</span>
<span class="i2">A month had flown, and with it fled disease;</span>
<span class="i0">What pleased before, began again to please;</span>
<span class="i0">Emerging daily from his chamber’s gloom, <span class="linenum">130</span></span>
<span class="i0">He found his old sensations hurrying home;</span>
<span class="i0">Then call’d his nephew, and exclaim’d, “My boy,</span>
<span class="i0">Let us again the balm of life enjoy;</span>
<span class="i0">The foe has left me, and I deem it right,</span>
<span class="i0">Should he return, to arm me for the fight.”</span>
<span class="i2">Thus spoke the ’squire, the favourite nymph stood by,</span>
<span class="i0">And view’d the priest with insult in her eye.</span>
<span class="i0">She thrice had heard him when he boldly spoke</span>
<span class="i0">On dangerous points, and fear’d he would revoke;</span>
<span class="i0">For James she loved not&mdash;and her manner told, <span class="linenum">140</span></span>
<span class="i0">“This warm affection will be quickly cold.”</span>
<span class="i0">And still she fear’d impression might be made</span>
<span class="i0">Upon a subject nervous and decay’d;</span>
<span class="i0">She knew her danger, and had no desire</span>
<span class="i0">Of reformation in the gallant ’squire;</span>
<span class="i0">And felt an envious pleasure in her breast</span>
<span class="i0">To see the rector daunted and distress’d.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
<span class="i2">Again the uncle to the youth applied&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“Cast, my dear lad, that cursed gloom aside:</span>
<span class="i0">There are for all things time and place; appear <span class="linenum">150</span></span>
<span class="i0">Grave in your pulpit, and be merry here.</span>
<span class="i0">Now take your wine&mdash;for woes a sure resource,</span>
<span class="i0">And the best prelude to a long discourse.”</span>
<span class="i2">James half obey’d, but cast an angry eye</span>
<span class="i0">On the fair lass, who still stood watchful by;</span>
<span class="i0">Resolving thus, “I have my fears&mdash;but still</span>
<span class="i0">I must perform my duties, and I will;</span>
<span class="i0">No love, no interest, shall my mind control;</span>
<span class="i0">Better to lose my comforts than my soul;</span>
<span class="i0">Better my uncle’s favour to abjure, <span class="linenum">160</span></span>
<span class="i0">Than the upbraidings of my heart endure.”</span>
<span class="i2">He took his glass, and then address’d the ’squire:</span>
<span class="i0">“I feel not well, permit me to retire.”</span>
<span class="i0">The ’squire conceived that the ensuing day</span>
<span class="i0">Gave him these terrors for the grand essay,</span>
<span class="i0">When he himself should this young preacher try,</span>
<span class="i0">And stand before him with observant eye;</span>
<span class="i0">This raised compassion in his manly breast,</span>
<span class="i0">And he would send the rector to his rest;</span>
<span class="i0">Yet first, in soothing voice&mdash;“A moment stay, <span class="linenum">170</span></span>
<span class="i0">And these suggestions of a friend obey;</span>
<span class="i0">Treasure these hints, if fame or peace you prize&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">The bottle emptied, I shall close my eyes.</span>
<span class="i2">“On every priest a two-fold care attends,</span>
<span class="i0">To prove his talents, and insure his friends:</span>
<span class="i0">First, of the first&mdash;your stores at once produce,</span>
<span class="i0">And bring your reading to its proper use;</span>
<span class="i0">On doctrines dwell, and every point enforce</span>
<span class="i0">By quoting much, the scholar’s sure resource;</span>
<span class="i0">For he alone can show us on each head <span class="linenum">180</span></span>
<span class="i0">What ancient schoolmen and sage fathers said:</span>
<span class="i0">No worth has knowledge, if you fail to show</span>
<span class="i0">How well you studied, and how much you know.</span>
<span class="i0">Is faith your subject, and you judge it right</span>
<span class="i0">On theme so dark to cast a ray of light:</span>
<span class="i0">Be it that faith the orthodox maintain,</span>
<span class="i0">Found in the rubrick, what the creeds explain;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Fail not to show us on this ancient faith</span>
<span class="i0">(And quote the passage) what some martyr saith.</span>
<span class="i0">Dwell not one moment on a faith that shocks <span class="linenum">190</span></span>
<span class="i0">The minds of men sincere and orthodox:</span>
<span class="i0">That gloomy faith, that robs the wounded mind</span>
<span class="i0">Of all the comfort it was wont to find</span>
<span class="i0">From virtuous acts, and to the soul denies</span>
<span class="i0">Its proper due for alms and charities;</span>
<span class="i0">That partial faith, that, weighing sins alone,</span>
<span class="i0">Lets not a virtue for a fault atone;</span>
<span class="i0">That starving faith, that would our tables clear,</span>
<span class="i0">And make one dreadful Lent of all the year;</span>
<span class="i0">And cruel too, for this is faith that rends <span class="linenum">200</span></span>
<span class="i0">Confiding beauties from protecting friends;</span>
<span class="i0">A faith that all embracing, what a gloom</span>
<span class="i0">Deep and terrific o’er the land would come!</span>
<span class="i0">What scenes of horror would that time disclose!</span>
<span class="i0">No sight but misery, and no sound but woes;</span>
<span class="i0">Your nobler faith, in loftier style convey’d,</span>
<span class="i0">Shall be with praise and admiration paid.</span>
<span class="i0">On points like these your hearers all admire</span>
<span class="i0">A preacher’s depth, and nothing more require;</span>
<span class="i0">Shall we a studious youth to college send, <span class="linenum">210</span></span>
<span class="i0">That every clown his words may comprehend?</span>
<span class="i0">’Tis for your glory, when your hearers own</span>
<span class="i0">Your learning matchless, but the sense unknown.</span>
<span class="i2">“Thus honour gain’d, learn now to gain a friend,</span>
<span class="i0">And the sure way is&mdash;never to offend;</span>
<span class="i0">For, James, consider&mdash;what your neighbours do</span>
<span class="i0">Is their own business, and concerns not you.</span>
<span class="i0">Shun all resemblance to that forward race</span>
<span class="i0">Who preach of sins before a sinner’s face;</span>
<span class="i0">And seem as if they overlook’d a pew, <span class="linenum">220</span></span>
<span class="i0">Only to drag a failing man in view.</span>
<span class="i0">Much should I feel, when groaning in disease,</span>
<span class="i0">If a rough hand upon my limb should seize;</span>
<span class="i0">But great my anger, if this hand were found</span>
<span class="i0">The very doctor’s, who should make it sound;</span>
<span class="i0">So feel our minds, young priest, so doubly feel,</span>
<span class="i0">When hurt by those whose office is to heal.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>

<span class="i2">The bells had toll’d&mdash;arrived the time of prayer,</span>

<span class="i0">And now can poet sing, or proseman say,</span>
<span class="i0">The disappointment of that trying day?</span>
<span class="i2">As he who long had train’d a favourite steed</span>
<span class="i0">(Whose blood and bone gave promise of his speed),</span>
<span class="i0">Sanguine with hope, he runs with partial eye</span>
<span class="i0">O’er every feature, and his bets are high;</span>
<span class="i0">Of triumph sure, he sees the rivals start,</span>
<span class="i0">And waits their coming with exulting heart; <span class="linenum">280</span></span>
<span class="i0">Forestalling glory, with impatient glance,</span>

<span class="i0">The conquering steed advances&mdash;luckless day!</span>
<span class="i0">A rival’s Herod bears the prize away;</span>
<span class="i0">Nor second his, nor third, but lagging last,</span>

<span class="i0">Surprise and wrath the owner’s mind inflame,</span>
<span class="i0">Love turns to scorn, and glory ends in shame:&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Thus waited, high in hope, the partial ’squire,</span>

<span class="i0">When the young preacher in the tones that find</span>
<span class="i0">A certain passage to the kindling mind,</span>
<span class="i0">With air and accent strange, impressive, sad,</span>
<span class="i0">Alarm’d the judge&mdash;he trembled for the lad;</span>
<span class="i0">But when the text announced the power of grace, &emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">Amazement scowl’d upon his clouded face, <span class="ws6">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">At this degenerate son of his illustrious race;<span class="ws6">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Staring he stood, till hope again arose,</span>

<span class="i0">The preacher always on forbidden ground.</span>
<span class="i2">And now the uncle left the hated pew,</span>
<span class="i0">With James, and James’s conduct in his view.</span>
<span class="i0">A long farewell to all his favourite schemes!<span class="ws3">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">For now no crazed fanatic’s frantic dreams<span class="ws4">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Seem’d vile as James’s conduct, or as James.&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">All he had long derided, hated, fear’d,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
<span class="i0">This from the chosen youth the uncle heard&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">The needless pause, the fierce disorder’d air,</span>
<span class="i0">The groan for sin, the vehemence of prayer, <span class="linenum">310</span></span>
<span class="i0">Gave birth to wrath, that, in a long discourse</span>
<span class="i0">Of grace, triumphant rose to four-fold force.</span>
<span class="i0">He found his thoughts despised, his rules transgress’d;&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">And, while the anger kindled in his breast, <span class="ws11">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">The pain must be endured that could not be express’d.&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">Each new idea more inflamed his ire,</span>
<span class="i0">As fuel thrown upon a rising fire:</span>
<span class="i0">A hearer yet, he sought by threatening sign</span>
<span class="i0">To ease his heart, and awe the young divine;</span>
<span class="i0">But James refused those angry looks to meet, <span class="linenum">320</span></span>
<span class="i0">Till he dismiss’d his flock, and left his seat.</span>
<span class="i0">Exhausted then he felt his trembling frame,</span>
<span class="i0">But fix’d his soul&mdash;his sentiments the same;</span>
<span class="i0">And therefore wise it seem’d to fly from rage,</span>
<span class="i0">And seek for shelter in his parsonage:</span>
<span class="i0">There, if forsaken, yet consoled to find</span>
<span class="i0">Some comforts left, though not a few resign’d;</span>
<span class="i0">There, if he lost an erring parent’s love,</span>
<span class="i0">An honest conscience must the cause approve;</span>
<span class="i0">If the nice palate were no longer fed, <span class="linenum">330</span></span>
<span class="i0">The mind enjoy’d delicious thoughts instead;</span>
<span class="i0">And if some part of earthly good was flown,</span>
<span class="i0">Still was the tithe of ten good farms his own.</span>
<span class="i2">Fear now, and discord, in the village reign,<span class="ws7">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">The cool remonstrate, and the meek complain;<span class="ws6">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">But there is war within, and wisdom pleads in vain.&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">Now dreads the uncle, and proclaims his dread,</span>
<span class="i0">Lest the boy-priest should turn each rustic head;</span>
<span class="i0">The certain converts cost him certain wo;</span>
<span class="i0">The doubtful fear lest they should join the foe; <span class="linenum">340</span></span>
<span class="i0">Matrons of old, with whom he used to joke,</span>
<span class="i0">Now pass his Honour with a pious look;</span>
<span class="i0">Lasses, who met him once with lively airs,</span>
<span class="i0">Now cross his way, and gravely walk to prayers;</span>
<span class="i0">An old companion, whom he long has loved,</span>
<span class="i0">By coward fears confess’d his conscience moved;</span>
<span class="i0">As the third bottle gave its spirit forth.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And they bore witness to departed worth,</span>
<span class="i0">The friend arose, and he too would depart&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“Man,” said the ’squire, “thou wert not wont to start; <span class="linenum">350</span></span>
<span class="i0">Hast thou attended to that foolish boy,</span>
<span class="i0">Who would abridge all comforts, or destroy?”</span>
<span class="i2">Yes, he had listen’d, who had slumber’d long,</span>
<span class="i0">And was convinced that something must be wrong;</span>
<span class="i0">But, though affected, still his yielding heart,</span>
<span class="i0">And craving palate, took the uncle’s part.</span>
<span class="i0">Wine now oppress’d him, who, when free from wine,</span>
<span class="i0">Could seldom clearly utter his design;</span>
<span class="i0">But, though by nature and indulgence weak,</span>
<span class="i0">Yet, half-converted, he resolved to speak; <span class="linenum">360</span></span>
<span class="i0">And, speaking, own’d, “that in his mind the youth</span>
<span class="i0">Had gifts and learning, and that truth was truth.</span>
<span class="i0">The ’squire he honour’d, and, for his poor part,</span>
<span class="i0">He hated nothing like a hollow heart;</span>
<span class="i0">But ’twas a maxim he had often tried,</span>
<span class="i0">That right was right, and there he would abide;</span>
<span class="i0">He honour’d learning, and he would confess</span>
<span class="i0">The preacher had his talents&mdash;more or less:</span>
<span class="i0">Why not agree? he thought the young divine</span>
<span class="i0">Had no such strictness&mdash;they might drink and dine, <span class="linenum">370</span></span>
<span class="i0">For them sufficient&mdash;but he said before,</span>
<span class="i0">That truth was truth, and he would drink no more.”</span>
<span class="i2">This heard the ’squire with mix’d contempt and pain;</span>
<span class="i0">He fear’d the priest this recreant sot would gain.</span>
<span class="i0">The favourite nymph, though not a convert made,</span>
<span class="i0">Conceived the man she scorn’d her cause would aid;</span>
<span class="i0">And when the spirits of her lord were low,</span>
<span class="i0">The lass presumed the wicked cause to show:</span>
<span class="i0">“It was the wretched life his Honour led,</span>
<span class="i0">And would draw vengeance on his guilty head; <span class="linenum">380</span></span>
<span class="i0">Their loves (Heav’n knew how dreadfully distress’d</span>
<span class="i0">The thought had made her!) were as yet unbless’d:</span>
<span class="i0">And till the church had sanction’d”&mdash;here she saw</span>
<span class="i0">The wrath that forced her trembling to withdraw.</span>
<span class="i2">Add to these outward ills some inward light,</span>
<span class="i0">That show’d him all was not correct and right:</span>
<span class="i0">Though now he less indulged&mdash;and to the poor,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
<span class="i0">From day to day, sent alms from door to door;</span>
<span class="i0">Though he some ease from easy virtues found,</span>
<span class="i0">Yet conscience told him he could not compound; <span class="linenum">390</span></span>
<span class="i0">But must himself the darling sin deny, <span class="ws17">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Change the whole heart&mdash;but here a heavy sigh<span class="ws10">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Proclaim’d, “How vast the toil! and ah! how weak am I!”&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i2">James too has trouble&mdash;he divided sees</span>
<span class="i0">A parish, once harmonious and at ease:</span>
<span class="i0">With him united are the simply meek,</span>
<span class="i0">The warm, the sad, the nervous, and the weak;</span>
<span class="i0">The rest his uncle’s, save the few beside,</span>
<span class="i0">Who own no doctrine, and obey no guide;</span>
<span class="i0">With stragglers of each adverse camp, who lend <span class="linenum">400</span></span>
<span class="i0">Their aid to both, but each in turn offend.</span>
<span class="i2">Though zealous still, yet he begins to feel</span>
<span class="i0">The heat too fierce, that glows in vulgar zeal;</span>
<span class="i0">With pain he hears his simple friends relate</span>
<span class="i0">Their week’s experience, and their woful state:</span>
<span class="i0">With small temptation struggling every hour,</span>
<span class="i0">And bravely battling with the tempting power;</span>
<span class="i0">His native sense is hurt by strange complaints</span>
<span class="i0">Of inward motions in these warring saints:</span>
<span class="i0">Who never cast on sinful bait a look <span class="linenum">410</span></span>
<span class="i0">But they perceive the devil at the hook.</span>
<span class="i0">Grieved, yet compell’d to smile, he finds it hard</span>
<span class="i0">Against the blunders of conceit to guard;</span>
<span class="i0">He sighs to hear the jests his converts cause,</span>
<span class="i0">He cannot give their erring zeal applause;</span>
<span class="i0">But finds it inconsistent to condemn</span>
<span class="i0">The flights and follies he has nursed in them:</span>
<span class="i0">These, in opposing minds, contempt produce,</span>
<span class="i0">Or mirth occasion, or provoke abuse;</span>
<span class="i0">On each momentous theme disgrace they bring, <span class="linenum">420</span></span>
<span class="i0">And give to Scorn her poison and her sting.</span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Anna was young and lovely&mdash;in her eye</span>
<span class="i0">The glance of beauty, in her cheek the dye;</span>
<span class="i0">Her shape was slender, and her features small,</span>
<span class="i0">But graceful, easy, unaffected all.</span>
<span class="i0">The liveliest tints her youthful face disclosed;</span>
<span class="i0">There beauty sparkled, and there health reposed;</span>
<span class="i0">For the pure blood that flush’d that rosy cheek</span>
<span class="i0">Spoke what the heart forbad the tongue to speak;</span>
<span class="i0">And told the feelings of that heart as well,</span>
<span class="i0">Nay, with more candour than the tongue could tell. <span class="linenum">10</span></span>
<span class="i0">Though this fair lass had with the wealthy dwelt,</span>
<span class="i0">Yet like the damsel of the cot she felt;</span>
<span class="i0">And, at the distant hint or dark surmise,</span>
<span class="i0">The blood into the mantling cheek would rise.</span>
<span class="i2">Now Anna’s station frequent terrors wrought</span>
<span class="i0">In one whose looks were with such meaning fraught;</span>
<span class="i0">For on a lady, as an humble friend,</span>
<span class="i0">It was her painful office to attend.</span>
<span class="i2">Her duties here were of the usual kind&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">And some the body harass’d, some the mind: <span class="linenum">20</span></span>
<span class="i0">Billets she wrote, and tender stories read,</span>
<span class="i0">To make the lady sleepy in her bed;</span>
<span class="i0">She play’d at whist, but with inferior skill,</span>
<span class="i0">And heard the summons as a call to drill;</span>
<span class="i0">Music was ever pleasant till she play’d</span>
<span class="i0">At a request that no request convey’d;</span>
<span class="i0">The lady’s tales with anxious looks she heard,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
<span class="i0">For she must witness what her friend averr’d;</span>
<span class="i0">The lady’s taste she must in all approve,</span>
<span class="i0">Hate whom she hated, whom she loved must love; <span class="linenum">30</span></span>
<span class="i0">These, with the various duties of her place,</span>
<span class="i0">With care she studied, and perform’d with grace;</span>
<span class="i0">She veil’d her troubles in a mask of ease,</span>
<span class="i0">And show’d her pleasure was a power to please.</span>
<span class="i2">Such were the damsel’s duties; she was poor&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Above a servant, but with service more.</span>
<span class="i0">Men on her face with careless freedom gazed,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor thought how painful was the glow they raised;</span>
<span class="i0">A wealthy few to gain her favour tried,</span>
<span class="i0">But not the favour of a grateful bride: <span class="linenum">40</span></span>
<span class="i0">They spoke their purpose with an easy air,</span>
<span class="i0">That shamed and frighten’d the dependent fair:</span>
<span class="i0">Past time she view’d, the passing time to cheat,</span>
<span class="i0">But nothing found to make the present sweet;</span>
<span class="i0">With pensive soul she read life’s future page,</span>
<span class="i0">And saw dependent, poor, repining age.</span>
<span class="i2">But who shall dare t’ assert what <i>years</i> may bring,</span>
<span class="i0">When wonders from the passing <i>hour</i> may spring?&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">There dwelt a yeoman in the place, whose mind</span>
<span class="i0">Was gentle, generous, cultivated, kind; <span class="linenum">50</span></span>
<span class="i0">For thirty years he labour’d; fortune then</span>
<span class="i0">Placed the mild rustic with superior men:</span>
<span class="i0">A richer Stafford, who had lived to save,</span>
<span class="i0">What he had treasured to the poorer gave;</span>
<span class="i0">Who with a sober mind that treasure view’d,</span>
<span class="i0">And the slight studies of his youth renew’d.</span>
<span class="i0">He not profoundly, but discreetly read,</span>
<span class="i0">And a fair mind with useful culture fed;</span>
<span class="i0">Then thought of marriage&mdash;“But the great,” said he,</span>
<span class="i0">“I shall not suit, nor will the meaner me.” <span class="linenum">60</span></span>
<span class="i0">Anna he saw, admired her modest air;</span>
<span class="i0">He thought her virtuous, and he knew her fair;</span>
<span class="i0">Love raised his pity for her humble state,</span>
<span class="i0">And prompted wishes for her happier fate;</span>
<span class="i0">No pride in money would his feelings wound,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor vulgar manners hurt him and confound:</span>
<span class="i0">He then the lady at the hall address’d,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Sought her consent, and his regard express’d;</span>
<span class="i0">Yet, if some cause his earnest wish denied,</span>
<span class="i0">He begg’d to know it; and he bow’d and sigh’d. <span class="linenum">70</span></span>
<span class="i2">The lady own’d that she was loth to part,</span>
<span class="i0">But praised the damsel for her gentle heart,</span>
<span class="i0">Her pleasing person, and her blooming health;</span>
<span class="i0">But ended thus, “Her virtue is her wealth.”</span>
<span class="i2">“Then is she rich!” he cried, with lively air;</span>
<span class="i0">“But whence, so please you, came a lass so fair?”</span>
<span class="i2">“A placeman’s child was Anna, one who died</span>
<span class="i0">And left a widow by afflictions tried;</span>
<span class="i0">She to support her infant daughter strove,</span>
<span class="i0">But early left the object of her love; <span class="linenum">80</span></span>
<span class="i0">Her youth, her beauty, and her orphan-state</span>
<span class="i0">Gave a kind countess interest in her fate;</span>
<span class="i0">With her she dwelt, and still might dwelling be,</span>
<span class="i0">When the earl’s folly caused the lass to flee;</span>
<span class="i0">A second friend was she compell’d to shun,</span>
<span class="i0">By the rude offers of an uncheck’d son;</span>
<span class="i0">I found her then, and with a mother’s love</span>
<span class="i0">Regard the gentle girl whom you approve.</span>
<span class="i0">Yet, e’en with me, protection is not peace;</span>
<span class="i0">Nor man’s designs, nor beauty’s trial, cease; <span class="linenum">90</span></span>
<span class="i0">Like sordid boys by costly fruit they feel:</span>
<span class="i0">They will not purchase, but they try to steal.”</span>
<span class="i2">Now this good lady, like a witness true,</span>
<span class="i0">Told but the truth, and all the truth she knew;</span>
<span class="i0">And ’tis our duty and our pain to show</span>
<span class="i0">Truth this good lady had not means to know.</span>
<span class="i0">Yes, there was lock’d within the damsel’s breast</span>
<span class="i0">A fact important to be now confess’d;</span>
<span class="i0">Gently, my muse, th’ afflicting tale relate,</span>
<span class="i0">And have some feeling for a sister’s fate. <span class="linenum">100</span></span>
<span class="i2">Where Anna dwelt, a conquering hero came&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">An Irish captain, Sedley was his name;</span>
<span class="i0">And he too had that same prevailing art,</span>
<span class="i0">That gave soft wishes to the virgin’s heart.</span>
<span class="i0">In years they differ’d; he had thirty seen</span>
<span class="i0">When this young beauty counted just fifteen;</span>
<span class="i0">But still they were a lovely lively pair,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And trod on earth as if they trod on air.</span>
<span class="i2">On love, delightful theme! the captain dwelt</span>
<span class="i0">With force still growing with the hopes he felt; <span class="linenum">110</span></span>
<span class="i0">But with some caution and reluctance told,</span>
<span class="i0">He had a father crafty, harsh, and old;</span>
<span class="i0">Who, as possessing much, would much expect,</span>
<span class="i0">Or both, for ever, from his love reject:</span>
<span class="i0">Why then offence to one so powerful give,</span>
<span class="i0">Who (for their comfort) had not long to live?</span>
<span class="i2">With this poor prospect the deluded maid,</span>
<span class="i0">In words confiding, was indeed betray’d;</span>
<span class="i0">And, soon as terrors in her bosom rose,</span>
<span class="i0">The hero fled; they hinder’d his repose. <span class="linenum">120</span></span>
<span class="i0">Deprived of him, she to a parent’s breast</span>
<span class="i0">Her secret trusted, and her pains impress’d:</span>
<span class="i0">Let her to town (so prudence urged) repair,</span>
<span class="i0">To shun disgrace, at least to hide it there;</span>
<span class="i0">But ere she went, the luckless damsel pray’d</span>
<span class="i0">A chosen friend might lend her timely aid:</span>
<span class="i0">“Yes! my soul’s sister, my Eliza, come,</span>
<span class="i0">Hear her last sigh, and ease thy Anna’s doom:”</span>
<span class="i0">“’Tis a fool’s wish,” the angry father cried,</span>
<span class="i0">But, lost in troubles of his own, complied; <span class="linenum">130</span></span>
<span class="i0">And dear Eliza to her friend was sent,</span>
<span class="i0">T’ indulge that wish, and be her punishment:</span>
<span class="i0">The time arrived, and brought a tenfold dread;</span>
<span class="i0">The time was past, and all the terror fled;</span>
<span class="i0">The infant died; the face resumed each charm,</span>
<span class="i0">And reason now brought trouble and alarm:</span>
<span class="i0">“Should her Eliza&mdash;no! she was too just,</span>
<span class="i0">Too good and kind&mdash;but ah! too young to trust.”</span>
<span class="i0">Anna return’d, her former place resumed,</span>
<span class="i0">And faded beauty with new grace re-bloom’d; <span class="linenum">140</span></span>
<span class="i0">And, if some whispers of the past were heard,</span>
<span class="i0">They died innoxious, as no cause appear’d;</span>
<span class="i0">But other cares on Anna’s bosom press’d,</span>
<span class="i0">She saw her father gloomy and distress’d;</span>
<span class="i0">He died o’erwhelm’d with debt, and soon was shed<span class="ws4">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">The filial sorrow o’er a mother dead: <span class="ws15">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">She sought Eliza’s arms, that faithful friend was wed;&emsp;}</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Then was compassion by the countess shown,</span>
<span class="i0">And all th’ adventures of her life are known.</span>
<span class="i2">And now beyond her hopes&mdash;no longer tried <span class="linenum">150</span></span>
<span class="i0">By slavish awe&mdash;she lived a yeoman’s bride;</span>
<span class="i0">Then bless’d her lot, and with a grateful mind</span>
<span class="i0">Was careful, cheerful, vigilant, and kind.</span>
<span class="i0">The gentle husband felt supreme delight,</span>
<span class="i0">Bless’d by her joy, and happy in her sight;</span>
<span class="i0">He saw with pride in every friend and guest</span>
<span class="i0">High admiration and regard express’d;</span>
<span class="i0">With greater pride, and with superior joy,</span>
<span class="i0">He look’d exulting on his first-born boy;</span>
<span class="i0">To her fond breast the wife her infant strain’d, <span class="linenum">160</span></span>
<span class="i0">Some feelings utter’d, some were not explain’d;</span>
<span class="i0">And she enraptured with her treasure grew,</span>
<span class="i0">The sight familiar, but the pleasure new.</span>
<span class="i2">Yet there appear’d within that tranquil state</span>
<span class="i0">Some threat’ning prospect of uncertain fate;</span>
<span class="i0">Between the married when a secret lies,</span>
<span class="i0">It wakes suspicion from enforced disguise.</span>
<span class="i0">Still thought the wife upon her absent friend,</span>
<span class="i0">With all that must upon her truth depend:</span>
<span class="i0">“There is no being in the world beside, <span class="linenum">170</span></span>
<span class="i0">Who can discover what that friend will hide;</span>
<span class="i0">Who knew the fact, knew not my name or state,</span>
<span class="i0">Who these can tell cannot the fact relate;</span>
<span class="i0">But thou, Eliza, canst the whole impart,</span>
<span class="i0">And all my safety is thy generous heart.”</span>
<span class="i2">Mix’d with these fears&mdash;but light and transient these&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Fled years of peace, prosperity, and ease;</span>
<span class="i0">So tranquil all that scarce a gloomy day</span>
<span class="i0">For days of gloom unmix’d prepared the way.</span>
<span class="i0">One eve, the wife, still happy in her state, <span class="linenum">180</span></span>
<span class="i0">Sang gaily, thoughtless of approaching fate;</span>
<span class="i0">Then came a letter, that (received in dread</span>
<span class="i0">Not unobserved) she in confusion read;</span>
<span class="i0">The substance this&mdash;“Her friend rejoiced to find</span>
<span class="i0">That she had riches with a grateful mind;</span>
<span class="i0">While poor Eliza had from place to place</span>
<span class="i0">Been lured by hope to labour for disgrace;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
<span class="i0">That every scheme her wandering husband tried,</span>
<span class="i0">Pain’d while he lived, and perish’d when he died.”</span>
<span class="i0">She then of want in angry style complain’d: <span class="ws16">}</span><span class="linenum">190</span></span>
<span class="i0">Her child a burthen to her life remain’d, <span class="ws19">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Her kindred shunn’d her prayers, no friend her soul sustain’d.&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i2">“Yet why neglected? Dearest Anna knew</span>
<span class="i0">Her worth once tried, her friendship ever true;</span>
<span class="i0">She hoped, she trusted, though by wants oppress’d,</span>
<span class="i0">To lock the treasured secret in her breast;</span>
<span class="i0">Yet, vex’d by trouble, must apply to one,</span>
<span class="i0">For kindness due to her for kindness done.”</span>
<span class="i2">In Anna’s mind was tumult; in her face</span>
<span class="i0">Flushings of dread had momentary place. <span class="linenum">200</span></span>
<span class="i0">“I must,” she judged, “these cruel lines expose,</span>
<span class="i0">Or fears, or worse than fears, my crime disclose.”</span>
<span class="i2">The letter shown, he said, with sober smile&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“Anna, your friend has not a friendly style.</span>
<span class="i0">Say, where could you with this fair lady dwell,</span>
<span class="i0">Who boasts of secrets that she scorns to tell?”</span>
<span class="i0">“At school,” she answer’d; he “at school!” replied;</span>
<span class="i0">“Nay, then I know the secrets you would hide:</span>
<span class="i0">Some [early] longings these, without dispute;</span>
<span class="i0">Some youthful gaspings for forbidden fruit. <span class="linenum">210</span></span>
<span class="i0">Why so disorder’d, love? are such the crimes</span>
<span class="i0">That give us sorrow in our graver times?</span>
<span class="i0">Come, take a present for your friend, and rest</span>
<span class="i0">In perfect peace&mdash;you find you are confess’d.”</span>
<span class="i2">This cloud, though past, alarm’d the conscious wife,</span>
<span class="i0">Presaging gloom and sorrow for her life;</span>
<span class="i0">Who to her answer join’d a fervent prayer,</span>
<span class="i0">That her Eliza would a sister spare:</span>
<span class="i0">If she again&mdash;but was there cause?&mdash;should send,</span>
<span class="i0">Let her direct&mdash;and then she named a friend.&mdash; <span class="linenum">220</span></span>
<span class="i0">A sad expedient, untried friends to trust,</span>
<span class="i0">And still to fear the tried may be unjust:</span>
<span class="i0">Such is his pain, who, by his debt oppress’d,</span>
<span class="i0">Seeks by new bonds a temporary rest.</span>
<span class="i2">Few were her peaceful days till Anna read</span><span class="i0">The words she dreaded, and had cause to dread:&mdash;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
<span class="i2">“Did she believe, did she, unkind, suppose</span>
<span class="i0">That thus Eliza’s friendship was to close?</span>
<span class="i0">No! though she tried, and her desire was plain,</span>
<span class="i0">To break the friendly bond, she strove in vain: <span class="linenum">230</span></span>
<span class="i0">Ask’d she for silence? why so loud the call,</span>
<span class="i0">And yet the token of her love so small?</span>
<span class="i0">By means like these will you attempt to bind</span>
<span class="i0">And check the movements of an injured mind?</span>
<span class="i0">Poor as I am, I shall be proud to show</span>
<span class="i0">What dangerous secrets I may safely know.</span>
<span class="i0">Secrets, to men of jealous minds convey’d,</span>
<span class="i0">Have many a noble house in ruins laid;</span>
<span class="i0">Anna, I trust, although with wrongs beset,</span>
<span class="i0">And urged by want, I shall be faithful yet; <span class="linenum">240</span></span>
<span class="i0">But what temptation may from these arise,</span>
<span class="i0">To take a slighted woman by surprise,</span>
<span class="i0">Becomes a subject for your serious care&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">For who offends, must for offence prepare.”</span>
<span class="i2">Perplex’d, dismay’d, the wife foresaw her doom;</span>
<span class="i0">A day deferr’d was yet a day to come;</span>
<span class="i0">But still, though painful her suspended state,</span>
<span class="i0">She dreaded more the crisis of her fate;</span>
<span class="i0">Better to die than Stafford’s scorn to meet,</span>
<span class="i0">And her strange friend perhaps would be discreet. <span class="linenum">250</span></span>
<span class="i0">Presents she sent, and made a strong appeal</span>
<span class="i0">To woman’s feelings, begging her to feel;</span>
<span class="i0">With too much force she wrote of jealous men,</span>
<span class="i0">And her tears falling spoke beyond the pen;</span>
<span class="i0">Eliza’s silence she again implored,</span>
<span class="i0">And promised all that prudence could afford.</span>
<span class="i2">For looks composed and careless Anna tried;</span>
<span class="i0">She seem’d in trouble, and unconscious sigh’d:</span>
<span class="i0">The faithful husband, who devoutly loved</span>
<span class="i0">His silent partner, with concern reproved: <span class="linenum">260</span></span>
<span class="i0">“What secret sorrows on my Anna press,</span>
<span class="i0">That love may not partake, nor care redress?”</span>
<span class="i0">“None, none,” she answer’d, with a look so kind,</span>
<span class="i0">That the fond man determined to be blind.</span>
<span class="i2">A few succeeding weeks of brief repose</span>
<span class="i0">In Anna’s cheek revived the faded rose;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
<span class="i0">A hue like this the western sky displays,</span>
<span class="i0">That glows awhile, and withers as we gaze.</span>
<span class="i2">Again the friend’s tormenting letter came&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“The wants she suffer’d were affection’s shame; <span class="linenum">270</span></span>
<span class="i0">She with her child a life of terrors led,</span>
<span class="i0">Unhappy fruit! but of a lawful bed.</span>
<span class="i0">Her friend was tasting every bliss in life,</span>
<span class="i0">The joyful mother, and the wealthy wife;</span>
<span class="i0">While she was placed in doubt, in fear, in want,</span>
<span class="i0">To starve on trifles that the happy grant;</span>
<span class="i0">Poorly for all her faithful silence paid,</span>
<span class="i0">And tantalized by ineffectual aid.</span>
<span class="i0">She could not thus a beggar’s lot endure;</span>
<span class="i0">She wanted something permanent and sure: <span class="linenum">280</span></span>
<span class="i0">If they were friends, then equal be their lot,</span>
<span class="i0">And she was free to speak if they were not.”</span>
<span class="i2">Despair and terror seized the wife, to find</span>
<span class="i0">The artful workings of a vulgar mind:</span>
<span class="i0">Money she had not, but the hint of dress</span>
<span class="i0">Taught her new bribes, new terrors to redress;</span>
<span class="i0">She with such feeling then described her woes,</span>
<span class="i0">That envy’s self might on the view repose;</span>
<span class="i0">Then to a mother’s pains she made appeal,</span>
<span class="i0">And painted grief like one compell’d to feel. <span class="linenum">290</span></span>
<span class="i2">Yes! so she felt, that in her air, her face,</span>
<span class="i0">In every purpose, and in every place;</span>
<span class="i0">In her slow motion, in her languid mien,</span>
<span class="i0">The grief, the sickness of her soul were seen.</span>
<span class="i2">Of some mysterious ill the husband sure,</span>
<span class="i0">Desired to trace it, for he hoped to cure;</span>
<span class="i0">Something he knew obscurely, and had seen</span>
<span class="i0">His wife attend a cottage on the green;</span>
<span class="i0">Love, loth to wound, endured conjecture long,</span>
<span class="i0">Till fear would speak, and spoke in language strong. <span class="linenum">300</span></span>
<span class="i2">“All I must know, my Anna&mdash;truly know</span>
<span class="i0">Whence these emotions, terrors, troubles flow;</span>
<span class="i0">Give me thy grief, and I will fairly prove</span>
<span class="i0">Mine is no selfish, no ungenerous love.”</span>
<span class="i2">Now Anna’s soul the seat of strife became:</span>
<span class="i0">Fear with respect contended, love with shame;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But fear, prevailing, was the ruling guide,</span>
<span class="i0">Prescribing what to show and what to hide.</span>
<span class="i2">“It is my friend,” she said&mdash;“but why disclose</span>
<span class="i0">A woman’s weakness struggling with her woes? <span class="linenum">310</span></span>
<span class="i0">Yes, she has grieved me by her fond complaints,</span>
<span class="i0">The wrongs she suffers, the distress she paints;</span>
<span class="i0">Something we do&mdash;but she afflicts me still,</span>
<span class="i0">And says, with power to help, I want the will.</span>
<span class="i0">This plaintive style I pity and excuse,</span>
<span class="i0">Help when I can, and grieve when I refuse;</span>
<span class="i0">But here my useless sorrows I resign,</span>
<span class="i0">And will be happy in a love like thine.”</span>
<span class="i2">The husband doubted; he was kind but cool:&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“’Tis a strong friendship to arise at school; <span class="linenum">320</span></span>
<span class="i0">Once more then, love, once more the sufferer aid&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">I too can pity, but I must upbraid;</span>
<span class="i0">Of these vain feelings then thy bosom free,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor be o’erwhelm’d by useless sympathy.”</span>
<span class="i2">The wife again despatch’d the useless bribe,</span>
<span class="i0">Again essay’d her terrors to describe;</span>
<span class="i0">Again with kindest words entreated peace,</span>
<span class="i0">And begg’d her offerings for a time might cease.</span>
<span class="i2">A calm succeeded, but too like the one</span>
<span class="i0">That causes terror ere the storm comes on: <span class="linenum">330</span></span>
<span class="i0">A secret sorrow lived in Anna’s heart,</span>
<span class="i0">In Stafford’s mind a secret fear of art;</span>
<span class="i0">Not long they lasted&mdash;this determined foe</span>
<span class="i0">Knew all her claims, and nothing would forego;</span>
<span class="i0">Again her letter came, where Anna read,</span>
<span class="i0">“My child, one cause of my distress, is dead;</span>
<span class="i0">Heav’n has my infant.” “Heartless wretch!” she cried,</span>
<span class="i0">“Is this thy joy?”&mdash;“I am no longer tied:</span>
<span class="i0">Now will I, hast’ning to my friend, partake</span>
<span class="i0">Her cares and comforts, and no more forsake; <span class="linenum">340</span></span>
<span class="i0">Now shall we both in equal station move,</span>
<span class="i0">Save that my friend enjoys a husband’s love.”</span>
<span class="i2">Complaint and threats so strong the wife amazed,</span>
<span class="i0">Who wildly on her cottage-neighbour gazed;</span>
<span class="i0">Her tones, her trembling, first betray’d her grief;</span>
<span class="i0">When floods of tears gave anguish its relief.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
<span class="i2">She fear’d that Stafford would refuse assent,</span>
<span class="i0">And knew her selfish friend would not relent;</span>
<span class="i0">She must petition, yet delay’d the task,</span>
<span class="i0">Ashamed, afraid, and yet compell’d to ask; <span class="linenum">350</span></span>
<span class="i0">Unknown to him some object filled her mind,</span>
<span class="i0">And, once suspicious, he became unkind.&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">They sate one evening, each absorb’d in gloom,<span class="ws10">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">When, hark! a noise and rushing to the room,<span class="ws12">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">The friend tripp’d lightly in, and laughing said, “I come.”&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i2">Anna received her with an anxious mind,</span>
<span class="i0">And meeting whisper’d, “Is Eliza kind?”</span>
<span class="i0">Reserved and cool, the husband sought to prove</span>
<span class="i0">The depth and force of this mysterious love.</span>
<span class="i0">To nought that pass’d between the stranger-friend <span class="linenum">360</span></span>
<span class="i0">And his meek partner seem’d he to attend;</span>
<span class="i0">But, anxious, listen’d to the lightest word</span>
<span class="i0">That might some knowledge of his guest afford;</span>
<span class="i0">And learn the reason one to him so dear</span>
<span class="i0">Should feel such fondness, yet betray such fear.</span>
<span class="i2">Soon he perceived this uninvited guest,</span>
<span class="i0">Unwelcome too, a sovereign power possess’d;</span>
<span class="i0">Lofty she was and careless, while the meek</span>
<span class="i0">And humbled Anna was afraid to speak:</span>
<span class="i0">As mute she listen’d with a painful smile, <span class="linenum">370</span></span>
<span class="i0">Her friend sate laughing and at ease the while,</span>
<span class="i0">Telling her idle tales with all the glee</span>
<span class="i0">Of careless and unfeeling levity.</span>
<span class="i0">With calm good sense he knew his wife endued,</span>
<span class="i0">And now with wounded pride her conduct view’d;</span>
<span class="i0">Her speech was low, her every look convey’d&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“I am a slave, subservient and afraid.”</span>
<span class="i0">All trace of comfort vanish’d if she spoke;</span>
<span class="i0">The noisy friend upon her purpose broke,</span>
<span class="i0">To her remarks with insolence replied, <span class="linenum">380</span></span>
<span class="i0">And her assertions doubted or denied;</span>
<span class="i0">While the meek Anna like an infant shook,</span>
<span class="i0">Wo-struck and trembling at the serpent’s look.</span>
<span class="i2">“There is,” said Stafford, “yes, there is a cause&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">This creature frights her, overpowers and awes.”</span>
<span class="i0">Six weeks had pass’d&mdash;“In truth, my love, this friend</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Has liberal notions; what does she intend?</span>
<span class="i0">Without a hint she came, and will she stay</span>
<span class="i0">Till she receives the hint to go away?”</span>
<span class="i2">Confused the wife replied, in spite of truth, <span class="linenum">390</span></span>
<span class="i0">“I love the dear companion of my youth.”</span>
<span class="i0">“’Tis well,” said Stafford; “then your loves renew;</span>
<span class="i0">Trust me, your rivals, Anna, will be few.”</span>
<span class="i2">Though playful this, she felt too much distress’d</span>
<span class="i0">T’ admit the consolation of a jest;</span>
<span class="i0">Ill she reposed, and in her dreams would sigh</span>
<span class="i0">And, murmuring forth her anguish, beg to die;</span>
<span class="i0">With sunken eye, slow pace, and pallid cheek,</span>
<span class="i0">She look’d confusion, and she fear’d to speak.</span>
<span class="i2">All this the friend beheld, for, quick of sight, <span class="linenum">400</span></span>
<span class="i0">She knew the husband eager for her flight;</span>
<span class="i0">And that by force alone she could retain</span>
<span class="i0">The lasting comforts she had hope to gain:</span>
<span class="i0">She now perceived, to win her post for life,</span>
<span class="i0">She must infuse fresh terrors in the wife;</span>
<span class="i0">Must bid to friendship’s feebler ties adieu,</span>
<span class="i0">And boldly claim the object in her view;</span>
<span class="i0">She saw the husband’s love, and knew the power</span>
<span class="i0">Her friend might use in some propitious hour.</span>
<span class="i2">Meantime the anxious wife, from pure distress <span class="linenum">410</span></span>
<span class="i0">Assuming courage, said, “I will confess;”</span>
<span class="i0">But with her children felt a parent’s pride,</span>
<span class="i0">And sought once more the hated truth to hide.</span>
<span class="i2">Offended, grieved, impatient, Stafford bore</span>
<span class="i0">The odious change till he could bear no more.</span>
<span class="i0">A friend to truth, in speech and action plain,</span>
<span class="i0">He held all fraud and cunning in disdain;</span>
<span class="i0">But fraud to find, and falsehood to detect,</span>
<span class="i0">For once he fled to measures indirect.</span>
<span class="i2">One day the friends were seated in that room <span class="linenum">420</span></span>
<span class="i0">The guest with care adorn’d, and named her home.</span>
<span class="i0">To please the eye, there curious prints were placed,</span>
<span class="i0">And some light volumes to amuse the taste;</span>
<span class="i0">Letters and music, on a table laid,</span>
<span class="i0">The favourite studies of the fair betray’d;</span>
<span class="i0">Beneath the window was the toilet spread,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And the fire gleam’d upon a crimson bed.</span>
<span class="i2">In Anna’s looks and falling tears were seen</span>
<span class="i0">How interesting had their subjects been:</span>
<span class="i0">“Oh! then,” resumed the friend, “I plainly find <span class="linenum">430</span></span>
<span class="i0">That you and Stafford know each other’s mind;</span>
<span class="i0">I must depart, must on the world be thrown,</span>
<span class="i0">Like one discarded, worthless and unknown;</span>
<span class="i0">But shall I carry, and to please a foe,</span>
<span class="i0">A painful secret in my bosom? No!</span>
<span class="i0">Think not your friend a reptile you may tread</span>
<span class="i0">Beneath your feet, and say, the worm is dead:</span>
<span class="i0">I have some feeling, and will not be made</span>
<span class="i0">The scorn of her whom love cannot persuade.</span>
<span class="i0">Would not your word, your slightest wish, effect <span class="linenum">440</span></span>
<span class="i0">All that I hope, petition, or expect?</span>
<span class="i0">The power you have, but you the use decline&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Proof that you feel not, or you fear not mine.</span>
<span class="i0">There was a time, when I, a tender maid,</span>
<span class="i0">Flew at a call, and your desires obey’d;</span>
<span class="i0">A very mother to the child became,</span>
<span class="i0">Consoled your sorrow, and conceal’d your shame;</span>
<span class="i0">But now, grown rich and happy, from the door</span>
<span class="i0">You thrust a bosom-friend, despised and poor;</span>
<span class="i0">That child alive, its mother might have known <span class="linenum">450</span></span>
<span class="i0">The hard, ungrateful spirit she has shown.”</span>
<span class="i2">Here paused the guest, and Anna cried at length&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“You try me, cruel friend! beyond my strength;</span>
<span class="i0">Would I had been beside my infant laid,</span>
<span class="i0">Where none would vex me, threaten, or upbraid.”</span>
<span class="i2">In Anna’s looks the friend beheld despair;</span>
<span class="i0">Her speech she soften’d, and composed her air;</span>
<span class="i0">Yet, while professing love, she answered still&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“You can befriend me, but you want the will.”</span>
<span class="i0">They parted thus, and Anna went her way, <span class="linenum">460</span></span>
<span class="i0">To shed her secret sorrows, and to pray.</span>
<span class="i2">Stafford, amused with books, and fond of home,</span>
<span class="i0">By reading oft dispell’d the evening gloom;</span>
<span class="i0">History or tale&mdash;all heard him with delight,</span>
<span class="i0">And thus was pass’d this memorable night.</span>
<span class="i2">The listening friend bestow’d a flattering smile;</span>

<span class="i0">A sleeping boy the mother held the while;</span>
<span class="i0">And, ere she fondly bore him to his bed,</span>
<span class="i0">On his fair face the tear of anguish shed.</span>
<span class="i2">And now, his task resumed, “My tale,” said he, <span class="linenum">470</span></span>
<span class="i0">“Is short and sad, short may our sadness be!”&mdash;</span>
<span class="i2">“The Caliph Harun<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>,
                  as historians tell,</span>
<span class="i0">Ruled, for a tyrant, admirably well;</span>
<span class="i0">Where his own pleasures were not touch’d, to men</span>
<span class="i0">He was humane, and sometimes even then.</span>
<span class="i0">Harun was fond of fruits, and gardens fair;</span>
<span class="i0">And wo to all whom he found poaching there.</span>
<span class="i0">Among his pages was a lively boy,</span>
<span class="i0">Eager in search of every trifling joy;</span>
<span class="i0">His feelings vivid, and his fancy strong, <span class="linenum">480</span></span>
<span class="i0">He sigh’d for pleasure while he shrank from wrong;</span>
<span class="i0">When by the caliph in the garden placed,</span>
<span class="i0">He saw the treasures which he long’d to taste;</span>
<span class="i0">And oft alone he ventured to behold</span>
<span class="i0">Rich hanging fruits with rind of glowing gold;</span>
<span class="i0">Too long he staid forbidden bliss to view,</span>
<span class="i0">His virtue failing, as his longings grew;</span>
<span class="i0">Athirst and wearied with the noon-tide heat,</span>
<span class="i0">Fate to the garden led his luckless feet;</span>
<span class="i0">With eager eyes and open mouth he stood, <span class="linenum">490</span></span>
<span class="i0">Smelt the sweet breath, and touch’d the fragrant food;</span>
<span class="i0">The tempting beauty sparkling in the sun</span>
<span class="i0">Charm’d his young sense&mdash;he ate, and was undone.</span>
<span class="i0">When the fond glutton paused, his eyes around</span>
<span class="i0">He turn’d, and eyes upon him turning found;</span>
<span class="i0">Pleased he beheld the spy, a brother-page,</span>
<span class="i0">A friend allied in office and in age;</span>
<span class="i0">Who promised much that secret he would be,</span>
<span class="i0">But high the price he fix’d on secrecy.</span>
<span class="i2">“‘Were you suspected, my unhappy friend,’ <span class="linenum">500</span></span>
<span class="i0">Began the boy, ‘where would your sorrows end?</span>
<span class="i0">In all the palace there is not a page</span>
<span class="i0">The caliph would not torture in his rage:</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
<span class="i0">I think I see thee now impaled alive,</span>
<span class="i0">Writhing in pangs&mdash;but come, my friend! revive;</span>
<span class="i0">Had some beheld you, all your purse contains</span>
<span class="i0">Could not have saved you from terrific pains;</span>
<span class="i0">I scorn such meanness; and, if not in debt,</span>
<span class="i0">Would not an asper on your folly set.’</span>
<span class="i2">“The hint was strong; young Osmyn search’d his store</span>
<span class="i0">For bribes, and found he soon could bribe no more; <span class="linenum">511</span></span>
<span class="i0">That time arrived, for Osmyn’s stock was small,</span>
<span class="i0">And the young tyrant now possess’d it all;</span>
<span class="i0">The cruel youth, with his companions near,</span>
<span class="i0">Gave the broad hint that raised the sudden fear;</span>
<span class="i0">Th’ ungenerous insult now was daily shown,</span>
<span class="i0">And Osmyn’s peace and honest pride were flown;</span>
<span class="i0">Then came augmenting woes, and fancy strong</span>
<span class="i0">Drew forms of suffering, a tormenting throng;</span>
<span class="i0">He felt degraded, and the struggling mind <span class="linenum">520</span></span>
<span class="i0">Dared not be free, and could not be resign’d;</span>
<span class="i0">And all his pains and fervent prayers obtain’d</span>
<span class="i0">Was truce from insult, while the fears remain’d.</span>
<span class="i2">“One day it chanced that this degraded boy</span>
<span class="i0">And tyrant-friend were fix’d at their employ;</span>
<span class="i0">Who now had thrown restraint and form aside,</span>
<span class="i0">And for his bribe in plainer speech applied:</span>
<span class="i0">‘Long have I waited, and the last supply</span>
<span class="i0">Was but a pittance, yet how patient I!</span>
<span class="i0">But, give me now what thy first terrors gave, <span class="linenum">530</span></span>
<span class="i0">My speech shall praise thee, and my silence save.’</span>
<span class="i2">“Osmyn had found, in many a dreadful day,</span>
<span class="i0">The tyrant fiercer when he seem’d in play:</span>
<span class="i0">He begg’d forbearance: ‘I have not to give;</span>
<span class="i0">Spare me awhile, although ’tis pain to live.</span>
<span class="i0">Oh! had that stolen fruit the power possess’d</span>
<span class="i0">To war with life, I now had been at rest.’</span>
<span class="i2">“‘So fond of death,’ replied the boy, ‘’tis plain</span>
<span class="i0">Thou hast no certain notion of the pain;</span>
<span class="i0">But, to the caliph were a secret shown, <span class="linenum">540</span></span>
<span class="i0">Death has no pain that would be then unknown,’</span>
<span class="i2">“Now,” says the story, “in a closet near,</span>
<span class="i0">The monarch, seated, chanced the boys to hear;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
<span class="i0">There oft he came, when wearied on his throne,</span>
<span class="i0">To read, sleep, listen, pray, or be alone.</span>
<span class="i2">“The tale proceeds: when first the caliph found</span>
<span class="i0">That he was robb’d, although alone, he frown’d;</span>
<span class="i0">And swore in wrath, that he would send the boy</span>
<span class="i0">Far from his notice, favour, or employ;</span>
<span class="i0">But gentler movements soothed his ruffled mind, <span class="linenum">550</span></span>
<span class="i0">And his own failings taught him to be kind.</span>
<span class="i2">“Relenting thoughts then painted Osmyn young,</span>
<span class="i0">His passion urgent, and temptation strong;</span>
<span class="i0">And that he suffer’d from that villain-spy</span>
<span class="i0">Pains worse than death till he desired to die;</span>
<span class="i0">Then, if his morals had received a stain,</span>
<span class="i0">His bitter sorrows made him pure again;</span>
<span class="i0">To Reason Pity lent her generous aid,</span>
<span class="i0">For one so tempted, troubled, and betray’d;</span>
<span class="i0">And a free pardon the glad boy restored <span class="linenum">560</span></span>
<span class="i0">To the kind presence of a gentle lord;</span>
<span class="i0">Who from his office and his country drove</span>
<span class="i0">That traitor-friend, whom pains nor pray’rs could move;</span>
<span class="i0">Who raised the fears no mortal could endure,</span>
<span class="i0">And then with cruel av’rice sold the cure.</span>
<span class="i2">“My tale is ended; but, to be applied,</span>
<span class="i0">I must describe the place where caliphs hide.”</span>
<span class="i2">Here both the females look’d alarm’d, distress’d,</span>
<span class="i0">With hurried passions hard to be express’d.</span>
<span class="i2">“It was a closet by a chamber placed, <span class="linenum">570</span></span>
<span class="i0">Where slept a lady of no vulgar taste;</span>
<span class="i0">Her friend attended in that chosen room</span>
<span class="i0">That she had honour’d and proclaim’d her home;</span>
<span class="i0">To please the eye were chosen pictures placed,</span>
<span class="i0">And some light volumes to amuse the taste;</span>
<span class="i0">Letters and music on a table laid,</span>
<span class="i0">For much the lady wrote, and often play’d;</span>
<span class="i0">Beneath the window was a toilet spread,</span>
<span class="i0">And a fire gleam’d upon a crimson bed.”</span>
<span class="i2">He paused, he rose; with troubled joy the wife <span class="linenum">580</span></span>
<span class="i0">Felt the new era of her changeful life;</span>
<span class="i0">Frankness and love appear’d in Stafford’s face,</span>
<span class="i0">And all her trouble to delight gave place.</span>

<span class="i2">Twice made the guest an effort to sustain <span class="ws13">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Her feelings, twice resumed her seat in vain,<span class="ws13">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Nor could suppress her shame, nor could support her pain.&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">Quick she retired, and all the dismal night</span>
<span class="i0">Thought of her guilt, her folly, and her flight;</span>
<span class="i0">Then sought unseen her miserable home,</span>
<span class="i0">To think of comforts lost, and brood on wants to come. <span class="linenum">590</span></span>

<span class="i0">Females there are of unsuspicious mind,</span>
<span class="i0">Easy and soft, and credulous and kind;</span>
<span class="i0">Who, when offended for the twentieth time,</span>
<span class="i0">Will hear th’ offender and forgive the crime;</span>
<span class="i0">And there are others whom, like these to cheat,</span>
<span class="i0">Asks but the humblest effort of deceit;</span>
<span class="i0">But they, once injured, feel a strong disdain,</span>
<span class="i0">And, seldom pardoning, never trust again;</span>
<span class="i0">Urged by religion, they forgive&mdash;but yet</span>
<span class="i0">Guard the warm heart, and never more forget. <span class="linenum">10</span></span>
<span class="i0">Those are like wax&mdash;apply them to the fire,</span>
<span class="i0">Melting, they take th’ impressions you desire;</span>
<span class="i0">Easy to mould, and fashion as you please,</span>
<span class="i0">And again moulded with an equal ease;</span>
<span class="i0">Like smelted iron these the forms retain,</span>
<span class="i0">But once impress’d will never melt again.</span>
<span class="i2">A busy port a serious merchant made</span>
<span class="i0">His chosen place to recommence his trade;</span>
<span class="i0">And brought his lady, who, their children dead,</span>
<span class="i0">Their native seat of recent sorrow fled. <span class="linenum">20</span></span>
<span class="i0">The husband duly on the quay was seen;</span>
<span class="i0">The wife at home became at length serene;</span>
<span class="i0">There in short time the social couple grew</span>
<span class="i0">With all acquainted, friendly with a few;</span>
<span class="i0">When the good lady, by disease assail’d,</span>
<span class="i0">In vain resisted&mdash;hope and science fail’d.</span>
<span class="i0">Then spake the female friends, by pity led,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
<span class="i0">“Poor merchant Paul! what think ye? will he wed?</span>
<span class="i0">A quiet, easy, kind, religious man,</span>
<span class="i0">Thus can he rest?&mdash;I wonder if he can.” <span class="linenum">30</span></span>
<span class="i2">He too, as grief subsided in his mind,</span>
<span class="i0">Gave place to notions of congenial kind;</span>
<span class="i0">Grave was the man, as we have told before;</span>
<span class="i0">His years were forty&mdash;he might pass for more;</span>
<span class="i0">Composed his features were, his stature low,</span>
<span class="i0">His air important, and his motion slow;</span>
<span class="i0">His dress became him, it was neat and plain,</span>
<span class="i0">The colour purple, and without a stain;</span>
<span class="i0">His words were few, and special was his care</span>
<span class="i0">In simplest terms his purpose to declare; <span class="linenum">40</span></span>
<span class="i0">A man more civil, sober, and discreet,</span>
<span class="i0">More grave and courteous, you could seldom meet.</span>
<span class="i0">Though frugal he, yet sumptuous was his board,</span>
<span class="i0">As if to prove how much he could afford;</span>
<span class="i0">For, though reserved himself, he loved to see</span>
<span class="i0">His table plenteous, and his neighbours free.</span>
<span class="i0">Among these friends he sat in solemn style,</span>
<span class="i0">And rarely soften’d to a sober smile;</span>
<span class="i0">For this observant friends their reasons gave&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“Concerns so vast would make the idlest grave; <span class="linenum">50</span></span>
<span class="i0">And for such man to be of language free,</span>
<span class="i0">Would seem incongruous as a singing tree:</span>
<span class="i0">Trees have their music, but the birds they shield</span>
<span class="i0">The pleasing tribute for protection yield;</span>
<span class="i0">Each ample tree the tuneful choir defends,</span>
<span class="i0">As this rich merchant cheers his happy friends!”</span>
<span class="i2">In the same town it was his chance to meet</span>
<span class="i0">A gentle lady, with a mind discreet;</span>
<span class="i0">Neither in life’s decline, nor bloom of youth,</span>
<span class="i0">One fam’d for maiden modesty and truth. <span class="linenum">60</span></span>
<span class="i0">By nature cool, in pious habits bred,</span>
<span class="i0">She look’d on lovers with a virgin’s dread:</span>
<span class="i0">Deceivers, rakes, and libertines were they,</span>
<span class="i0">And harmless beauty their pursuit and prey;</span>
<span class="i0">As bad as giants in the ancient times</span>
<span class="i0">Were modern lovers, and the same their crimes.</span>
<span class="i0">Soon as she heard of her all-conquering charms,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
<span class="i0">At once she fled to her defensive arms;</span>
<span class="i0">Conn’d o’er the tales her maiden aunt had told,</span>
<span class="i0">And, statue-like, was motionless and cold; <span class="linenum">70</span></span>
<span class="i0">From prayer of love, like that Pygmalion pray’d,</span>
<span class="i0">Ere the hard stone became the yielding maid,</span>
<span class="i0">A different change in this chaste nymph ensued,</span>
<span class="i0">And turn’d to stone the breathing flesh and blood.</span>
<span class="i0">Whatever youth described his wounded heart,</span>
<span class="i0">“He came to rob her, and she scorn’d his art;</span>
<span class="i0">And who of raptures once presumed to speak,</span>
<span class="i0">Told listening maids he thought them fond and weak.</span>
<span class="i0">But should a worthy man his hopes display</span>
<span class="i0">In few plain words, and beg a <i>yes</i> or <i>nay</i>, <span class="linenum">80</span></span>
<span class="i0">He would deserve an answer just and plain,&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">Since adulation only moved disdain&mdash;<span class="ws6">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Sir, if my friends object not, come again.”<span class="ws3">}</span></span>
<span class="i2">Hence, our grave lover, though he liked the face,</span>
<span class="i0">Praised not a feature&mdash;dwelt not on a grace;</span>
<span class="i0">But in the simplest terms declared his state:</span>
<span class="i0">“A widow’d man, who wish’d a virtuous mate;</span>
<span class="i0">Who fear’d neglect, and was compell’d to trust</span>
<span class="i0">Dependents wasteful, idle, or unjust;</span>
<span class="i0">Or, should they not the trusted stores destroy, <span class="linenum">90</span></span>
<span class="i0">At best, they could not help him to enjoy;</span>
<span class="i0">But with her person and her prudence blest,</span>
<span class="i0">His acts would prosper, and his soul have rest.</span>
<span class="i0">Would she be his?”&mdash;“Why, that was much to say;</span>
<span class="i0">She would consider; he awhile might stay;</span>
<span class="i0">She liked his manners, and believed his word;</span>
<span class="i0">He did not flatter, flattery she abhorr’d;</span>
<span class="i0">It was her happy lot in peace to dwell&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Would change make better what was now so well?</span>
<span class="i0">But she would ponder.”&mdash;-“This,” he said, “was kind,” <span class="linenum">100</span></span>
<span class="i0">And begg’d to know “when she had fix’d her mind.”</span>
<span class="i2">Romantic maidens would have scorn’d the air,</span>
<span class="i0">And the cool prudence of a mind so fair;</span>
<span class="i0">But well it pleased this wiser maid to find</span>
<span class="i0">Her own mild virtues in her lover’s mind.</span>
<span class="i2">His worldly wealth she sought, and quickly grew</span>
<span class="i0">Pleased with her search, and happy in the view</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Of vessels freighted with abundant stores,</span>
<span class="i0">Of rooms whose treasures press’d the groaning floors;</span>
<span class="i0">And he of clerks and servants could display <span class="linenum">110</span></span>
<span class="i0">A little army, on a public day:</span>
<span class="i0">Was this a man like needy bard to speak</span>
<span class="i0">Of balmy lip, bright eye, or rosy cheek?</span>
<span class="i2">The sum appointed for her widow’d state,</span>
<span class="i0">Fix’d by her friend, excited no debate;</span>
<span class="i0">Then the kind lady gave her hand and heart,</span>
<span class="i0">And, never finding, never dealt with art:</span>
<span class="i0">In his engagements she had no concern;</span>
<span class="i0">He taught her not, nor had she wish to learn:</span>
<span class="i0">On him in all occasions she relied, <span class="linenum">120</span></span>
<span class="i0">His word her surety, and his worth her pride.</span>
<span class="i2">When ship was launch’d, and merchant Paul had share,</span>
<span class="i0">A bounteous feast became the lady’s care;</span>
<span class="i0">Who then her entry to the dinner made,</span>
<span class="i0">In costly raiment, and with kind parade.</span>
<span class="i2">Call’d by this duty on a certain day,</span>
<span class="i0">And robed to grace it in a rich array,</span>
<span class="i0">Forth from her room with measured step she came,</span>
<span class="i0">Proud of th’ event, and stately look’d the dame.</span>
<span class="i0">The husband met her at his study-door&mdash; <span class="linenum">130</span></span>
<span class="i0">“This way, my love&mdash;one moment and no more:</span>
<span class="i0">A trifling business&mdash;you will understand,</span>
<span class="i0">The law requires that you affix your hand;</span>
<span class="i0">But first attend, and you shall learn the cause</span>
<span class="i0">Why forms like these have been prescribed by laws:”</span>
<span class="i0">Then from his chair a man in black arose,</span>
<span class="i0">And with much quickness hurried off his prose:</span>
<span class="i0">That “Ellen Paul the wife, and so forth, freed</span>
<span class="i0">From all control, her own the act and deed,</span>
<span class="i0">And forasmuch”&mdash;&mdash;said she, “I’ve no distrust, <span class="linenum">140</span></span>
<span class="i0">For he that asks it is discreet and just;</span>
<span class="i0">Our friends are waiting&mdash;where am I to sign?&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">There!&mdash;Now be ready when we meet to dine.”</span>
<span class="i2">This said, she hurried off in great delight:</span>
<span class="i0">The ship was launch’d, and joyful was the night.</span>
<span class="i2">Now, says the reader, and in much disdain,</span>
<span class="i0">This serious merchant was a rogue in grain;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
<span class="i0">A treacherous wretch, an artful, sober knave,</span>
<span class="i0">And ten times worse for manners cool and grave;</span>
<span class="i0">And she devoid of sense, to set her hand <span class="linenum">150</span></span>
<span class="i0">To scoundrel deeds she could not understand.</span>
<span class="i2">Alas! ’tis true; and I in vain had tried</span>
<span class="i0">To soften crime, that cannot be denied;</span>
<span class="i0">And might have labour’d many a tedious verse</span>
<span class="i0">The latent cause of mischief to rehearse:</span>
<span class="i0">Be it confess’d, that long with troubled look</span>
<span class="i0">This trader view’d a huge accompting-book</span>
<span class="i0">(His former marriage for a time delay’d</span>
<span class="i0">The dreaded hour, the present lent its aid);</span>
<span class="i0">But he too clearly saw the evil day, <span class="linenum">160</span></span>
<span class="i0">And put the terror, by deceit, away;</span>
<span class="i0">Thus by connecting with his sorrows crime,</span>
<span class="i0">He gain’d a portion of uneasy time.&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">All this too late the injured lady saw,</span>
<span class="i0">What law had given, again she gave to law;</span>
<span class="i0">His guilt, her folly&mdash;these at once impress’d</span>
<span class="i0">Their lasting feelings on her guileless breast.</span>
<span class="i2">“Shame I can bear,” she cried, “and want sustain,</span>
<span class="i0">But will not see this guilty wretch again:”</span>
<span class="i0">For all was lost, and he, with many a tear, <span class="linenum">170</span></span>
<span class="i0">Confess’d the fault&mdash;she turning scorn’d to hear.</span>
<span class="i0">To legal claims he yielded all his worth;</span>
<span class="i0">But small the portion, and the wrong’d were wroth,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor to their debtor would a part allow;</span>
<span class="i0">And where to live he knew not&mdash;knew not how.</span>
<span class="i2">The wife a cottage found, and thither went</span>
<span class="i0">The suppliant man, but she would not relent;</span>
<span class="i0">Thenceforth she utter’d with indignant tone,</span>
<span class="i0">“I feel the misery, and will feel alone.”</span>
<span class="i0">He would turn servant for her sake, would keep <span class="linenum">180</span></span>
<span class="i0">The poorest school; the very streets would sweep,</span>
<span class="i0">To show his love&mdash;“It was already shown,</span>
<span class="i0">And her affliction should be all her own.</span>
<span class="i0">His wants and weakness might have touch’d her heart,</span>
<span class="i0">But from his meanness she resolved to part.”</span>
<span class="i2">In a small alley was she lodged, beside</span>
<span class="i0">Its humblest poor, and at the view she cried:</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
<span class="i0">“Welcome&mdash;yes! let me welcome, if I can,</span>
<span class="i0">The fortune dealt me by this cruel man;</span>
<span class="i0">Welcome this low thatch’d roof, this shatter’d door, <span class="linenum">190</span></span>
<span class="i0">These walls of clay, this miserable floor;</span>
<span class="i0">Welcome my envied neighbours; this, to you,</span>

<span class="i0">You have no hatred to the loathsome meal;<span class="ws8">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Your firmer nerves no trembling terrors feel, <span class="ws6">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Nor, what you must expose, desire you to conceal;&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">What your coarse feelings bear without offence,</span>
<span class="i0">Disgusts my taste, and poisons every sense.</span>
<span class="i0">Daily shall I your sad relations hear,</span>
<span class="i0">Of wanton women, and of men severe; <span class="linenum">200</span></span>
<span class="i0">There will dire curses, dreadful oaths abound,</span>
<span class="i0">And vile expressions shock me and confound;</span>
<span class="i0">Noise of dull wheels, and songs with horrid words,</span>
<span class="i0">Will be the music that this lane affords;</span>
<span class="i0">Mirth that disgusts, and quarrels that degrade</span>
<span class="i0">The human mind, must my retreat invade.</span>
<span class="i0">Hard is my fate! yet easier to sustain,</span>
<span class="i0">Than to abide with guilt and fraud again,</span>
<span class="i0">A grave impostor&mdash;who expects to meet,</span>
<span class="i0">In such grey locks and gravity, deceit? <span class="linenum">210</span></span>
<span class="i0">Where the sea rages, and the billows roar,</span>
<span class="i0">Men know the danger, and they quit the shore;</span>
<span class="i0">But, be there nothing in the way descried,</span>
<span class="i0">When o’er the rocks smooth runs the wicked tide&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Sinking unwarn’d, they execrate the shock,</span>
<span class="i0">And the dread peril of the sunken rock.”</span>
<span class="i2">A frowning world had now the man to dread,</span>
<span class="i0">Taught in no arts, to no profession bred;</span>
<span class="i0">Pining in grief, beset with constant care,</span>
<span class="i0">Wandering he went, to rest he knew not where. <span class="linenum">220</span></span>
<span class="i2">Meantime the wife&mdash;but she abjured the name&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Endured her lot, and struggled with the shame:</span>
<span class="i0">When, lo! an uncle on the mother’s side,</span>
<span class="i0">In nature something, as in blood allied,</span>
<span class="i0">Admired her firmness, his protection gave,</span>
<span class="i0">And show’d a kindness she disdain’d to crave.</span>
<span class="i2">Frugal and rich the man, and frugal grew</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The sister-mind, without a selfish view;</span>
<span class="i0">And further still&mdash;the temp’rate pair agreed</span>
<span class="i0">With what they saved the patient poor to feed. <span class="linenum">230</span></span>
<span class="i0">His whole estate, when to the grave consign’d,</span>
<span class="i0">Left the good kinsman to the kindred mind;</span>
<span class="i0">Assured that law, with spell secure and tight,</span>
<span class="i0">Had fix’d it as her own peculiar right.</span>
<span class="i2">Now to her ancient residence removed,</span>
<span class="i0">She lived as widow, well endow’d and loved;</span>
<span class="i0">Decent her table was, and to her door</span>
<span class="i0">Came daily welcomed the neglected poor.</span>
<span class="i0">The absent sick were soothed by her relief,</span>
<span class="i0">As her free bounty sought the haunts of grief; <span class="linenum">240</span></span>
<span class="i0">A plain and homely charity had she,</span>
<span class="i0">And loved the objects of her alms to see;</span>
<span class="i0">With her own hands she dress’d the savoury meat,</span>
<span class="i0">With her own fingers wrote the choice receipt;</span>
<span class="i0">She heard all tales that injured wives relate,</span>
<span class="i0">And took a double interest in their fate;</span>
<span class="i0">But of all husbands not a wretch was known</span>
<span class="i0">So vile, so mean, so cruel, as her own.</span>
<span class="i2">This bounteous lady kept an active spy,</span>
<span class="i0">To search th’ abodes of want, and to supply; <span class="linenum">250</span></span>
<span class="i0">The gentle Susan served the liberal dame&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Unlike their notions, yet their deeds the same:</span>
<span class="i0">No practised villain could a victim find,</span>
<span class="i0">Than this stern lady more completely blind;</span>
<span class="i0">Nor (if detected in his fraud) could meet</span>
<span class="i0">One less disposed to pardon a deceit;</span>
<span class="i0">The wrong she treasured, and on no pretence</span>
<span class="i0">Received th’ offender, or forgot th’ offence;</span>
<span class="i0">But the kind servant, to the thrice-proved knave</span>
<span class="i0">A fourth time listen’d, and the past forgave. <span class="linenum">260</span></span>
<span class="i2">First in her youth, when she was blithe and gay,</span>
<span class="i0">Came a smooth rogue, and stole her love away;</span>
<span class="i0">Then to another and another flew,</span>
<span class="i0">To boast the wanton mischief he could do.</span>
<span class="i0">Yet she forgave him, though so great her pain,</span>
<span class="i0">That she was never blithe or gay again.</span>
<span class="i2">Then came a spoiler, who, with villain-art,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Implored her hand, and agonized her heart;</span>
<span class="i0">He seized her purse, in idle waste to spend</span>
<span class="i0">With a vile wanton, whom she call’d her friend; <span class="linenum">270</span></span>
<span class="i0">Five years she suffer’d&mdash;he had revell’d five&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Then came to show her he was just alive;</span>
<span class="i0">Alone he came, his vile companion dead,</span>
<span class="i0">And he, a wand’ring pauper, wanting bread;</span>
<span class="i0">His body wasted, wither’d life and limb,</span>
<span class="i0">When this kind soul became a slave to him.</span>
<span class="i0">Nay, she was sure that, should he now survive,</span>
<span class="i0">No better husband would be left alive;</span>
<span class="i0">For him she mourn’d, and then, alone and poor,</span>
<span class="i0">Sought and found comfort at her lady’s door: <span class="linenum">280</span></span>
<span class="i0">Ten years she served, and, mercy her employ,</span>
<span class="i0">Her tasks were pleasure, and her duty joy.</span>
<span class="i2">Thus lived the mistress and the maid, design’d</span>
<span class="i0">Each other’s aid&mdash;one cautious, and both kind.</span>
<span class="i0">Oft at their window, working, they would sigh</span>
<span class="i0">To see the aged and the sick go by;</span>
<span class="i0">Like wounded bees, that at their home arrive,</span>
<span class="i0">Slowly and weak, but labouring for the hive.</span>
<span class="i2">The busy people of a mason’s yard</span>
<span class="i0">The curious lady view’d with much regard; <span class="linenum">290</span></span>
<span class="i0">With steady motion she perceived them draw</span>
<span class="i0">Through blocks of stone the slowly-working saw;</span>
<span class="i0">It gave her pleasure and surprise to see</span>
<span class="i0">Among these men the signs of revelry;</span>
<span class="i0">Cold was the season, and confined their view,</span>
<span class="i0">Tedious their tasks, but merry were the crew.</span>
<span class="i0">There she beheld an aged pauper wait,</span>
<span class="i0">Patient and still, to take an humble freight;</span>
<span class="i0">Within the panniers on an ass he laid</span>
<span class="i0">The ponderous grit, and for the portion paid; <span class="linenum">300</span></span>
<span class="i0">This he re-sold, and, with each trifling gift,</span>
<span class="i0">Made shift to live, and wretched was the shift.</span>
<span class="i2">Now will it be by every reader told</span>
<span class="i0">Who was this humble trader, poor and old.&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">In vain an author would a name suppress,</span>
<span class="i0">From the least hint a reader learns to guess;</span>
<span class="i0">Of children lost our novels sometimes treat;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
<span class="i0">We never care&mdash;assured again to meet.</span>
<span class="i0">In vain the writer for concealment tries,</span>
<span class="i0">We trace his purpose under all disguise; <span class="linenum">310</span></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, though he tells us they are dead and gone,</span>
<span class="i0">Of whom we wot&mdash;they will appear anon;</span>
<span class="i0">Our favourites fight, are wounded, hopeless lie;</span>
<span class="i0">Survive they cannot&mdash;nay, they cannot die:</span>
<span class="i0">Now, as these tricks and stratagems are known,</span>
<span class="i0">’Tis best, at once, the simple truth to own.</span>
<span class="i2">This was the husband&mdash;in an humble shed</span>
<span class="i0">He nightly slept, and daily sought his bread.</span>
<span class="i0">Once for relief the weary man applied;</span>
<span class="i0">“Your wife is rich,” the angry vestry cried; <span class="linenum">320</span></span>
<span class="i0">Alas! he dared not to his wife complain,</span>
<span class="i0">Feeling her wrongs, and fearing her disdain:</span>
<span class="i0">By various methods he had tried to live,</span>
<span class="i0">But not one effort would subsistence give.</span>
<span class="i0">He was an usher in a school, till noise</span>
<span class="i0">Made him less able than the weaker boys;</span>
<span class="i0">On messages he went, till he in vain</span>
<span class="i0">Strove names, or words, or meanings to retain;</span>
<span class="i0">Each small employment in each neighbouring town</span>
<span class="i0">By turn he took, to lay as quickly down; <span class="linenum">330</span></span>
<span class="i0">For, such his fate, he fail’d in all he plann’d,</span>
<span class="i0">And nothing prosper’d in his luckless hand.</span>
<span class="i2">At his old home, his motive half suppress’d,</span>
<span class="i0">He sought no more for riches, but for rest:</span>
<span class="i0">There lived the bounteous wife, and at her gate</span>
<span class="i0">He saw in cheerful groups the needy wait;</span>
<span class="i0">“Had he a right with bolder hope t’ apply?”</span>
<span class="i0">He ask’d&mdash;was answer’d, and went groaning by;</span>
<span class="i0">For some remains of spirit, temper, pride,</span>
<span class="i0">Forbade a prayer he knew would be denied. <span class="linenum">340</span></span>
<span class="i2">Thus was the grieving man, with burthen’d ass,</span>
<span class="i0">Seen day by day along the street to pass:</span>
<span class="i0">“Who is he, Susan? who the poor old man?</span>
<span class="i0">He never calls&mdash;do make him, if you can.”&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">The conscious damsel still delay’d to speak,</span>
<span class="i0">She stopp’d confused, and had her words to seek;</span>
<span class="i0">From Susan’s fears the fact her mistress knew,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And cried&mdash;“The wretch! what scheme has he in view?</span>
<span class="i0">Is this his lot?&mdash;but let him, let him feel&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Who wants the courage, not the will to steal.” <span class="linenum">350</span></span>
<span class="i2">A dreadful winter came, each day severe,</span>
<span class="i0">Misty when mild, and icy cold when clear;</span>
<span class="i0">And still the humble dealer took his load,</span>
<span class="i0">Returning slow, and shivering on the road:</span>
<span class="i0">The lady, still relentless, saw him come,</span>
<span class="i0">And said&mdash;“I wonder, has the wretch a home?”&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“A hut! a hovel!”&mdash;“Then his fate appears</span>
<span class="i0">To suit his crime;”&mdash;“Yes, lady, not his years&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">No! nor his sufferings&mdash;nor that form decay’d.”&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“Well! let the parish give its paupers aid; <span class="linenum">360</span></span>
<span class="i0">You must the vileness of his acts allow.”&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“And you, dear lady, that he feels it now.”&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“When such dissemblers on their deeds reflect,</span>
<span class="i0">Can they the pity they refused expect?</span>
<span class="i0">He that doth evil, evil shall he dread.”&mdash;<span class="ws13">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">“The snow,” quoth Susan, “falls upon his bed&mdash;<span class="ws7">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">It blows beside the thatch&mdash;it melts upon his head.”&mdash;&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">“’Tis weakness, child, for grieving guilt to feel.”&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“Yes, but he never sees a wholesome meal;</span>
<span class="i0">Through his bare dress appears his shrivell’d skin, <span class="linenum">370</span></span>
<span class="i0">And ill he fares without, and worse within;</span>
<span class="i0">With that weak body, lame, diseased, and slow,</span>
<span class="i0">What cold, pain, peril, must the sufferer know!”&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“Think on his crime.”&mdash;“Yes, sure ’twas very wrong;</span>
<span class="i0">But look, (God bless him!) how he gropes along.”&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“Brought me to shame.”&mdash;“Oh! yes, I know it all&mdash;&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">What cutting blast! and he can scarcely crawl; <span class="ws6">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">He freezes as he moves&mdash;he dies! if he should fall.<span class="ws3">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">With cruel fierceness drives this icy sleet&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">And must a Christian perish in the street, <span class="linenum">380</span></span>
<span class="i0">In sight of Christians?&mdash;There! at last, he lies;</span>
<span class="i0">Nor unsupported can he ever rise:</span>
<span class="i0">He cannot live.”&mdash;“But is he fit to die?”&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Here Susan softly mutter’d a reply,</span>
<span class="i0">Look’d round the room&mdash;said something of its state,</span>
<span class="i0">Dives the rich, and Lazarus at his gate;</span>
<span class="i0">And then, aloud&mdash;“In pity do behold</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The man affrighten’d, weeping, trembling, cold.</span>
<span class="i0">Oh! how those flakes of snow their entrance win</span>
<span class="i0">Through the poor rags, and keep the frost within; <span class="linenum">390</span></span>
<span class="i0">His very heart seems frozen as he goes,</span>
<span class="i0">Leading that starved companion of his woes:</span>
<span class="i0">He tried to pray&mdash;his lips, I saw them move,</span>
<span class="i0">And he so turn’d his piteous looks above;</span>
<span class="i0">But the fierce wind the willing heart opposed,</span>
<span class="i0">And, ere he spoke, the lips in misery closed.</span>
<span class="i0">Poor suffering object! yes, for ease you pray’d,</span>
<span class="i0">And God will hear&mdash;he only, I’m afraid.”&mdash;</span>
<span class="i2">“Peace! Susan, peace! Pain ever follows sin.”&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“Ah! then,” thought Susan, “when will ours begin? <span class="linenum">400</span></span>
<span class="i0">When reach’d his home, to what a cheerless fire</span>
<span class="i0">And chilling bed will those cold limbs retire!</span>
<span class="i0">Yet ragged, wretched as it is, that bed</span>
<span class="i0">Takes half the space of his contracted shed;</span>
<span class="i0">I saw the thorns beside the narrow grate,</span>
<span class="i0">With straw collected in a putrid state.</span>
<span class="i0">There will he, kneeling, strive the fire to raise,</span>
<span class="i0">And that will warm him, rather than the blaze;</span>
<span class="i0">The sullen, smoky blaze, that cannot last</span>
<span class="i0">One moment after his attempt is past: <span class="linenum">410</span></span>
<span class="i0">And I so warmly and so purely laid,</span>
<span class="i0">To sink to rest&mdash;indeed, I am afraid.”&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“Know you his conduct?”&mdash;“Yes, indeed, I know&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">And how he wanders in the wind and snow:</span>
<span class="i0">Safe in our rooms the threat’ning storm we hear,</span>
<span class="i0">But he feels strongly what we faintly fear.”&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“Wilful was rich, and he the storm defied;</span>
<span class="i0">Wilful is poor, and must the storm abide;”</span>
<span class="i0">Said the stern lady;&mdash;“’tis in vain to feel;</span>
<span class="i0">Go and prepare the chicken for our meal.” <span class="linenum">420</span></span>
<span class="i2">Susan her task reluctantly began,</span>
<span class="i0">And utter’d as she went&mdash;“The poor old man!”&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">But while her soft and ever-yielding heart</span>
<span class="i0">Made strong protest against her lady’s part,</span>
<span class="i0">The lady’s self began to think it wrong,</span>
<span class="i0">To feel so wrathful and resent so long.</span>
<span class="i2">“No more the wretch would she receive again,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
<span class="i0">No more behold him&mdash;but she would sustain;</span>
<span class="i0">Great his offence, and evil was his mind&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">But he had suffer’d, and she would be kind: <span class="linenum">430</span></span>
<span class="i0">She spurn’d such baseness, and she found within</span>
<span class="i0">A fair acquittal from so foul a sin;</span>
<span class="i0">Yet she too err’d, and must of Heaven expect</span>
<span class="i0">To be rejected, him should she reject.”</span>
<span class="i2">Susan was summon’d&mdash;“I’m about to do</span>
<span class="i0">A foolish act, in part seduced by you:</span>
<span class="i0">Go to the creature&mdash;say that I intend,</span>
<span class="i0">Foe to his sins, to be his sorrow’s friend;</span>
<span class="i0">Take, for his present comforts, food and wine,</span>
<span class="i0">And mark his feelings at this act of mine; <span class="linenum">440</span></span>
<span class="i0">Observe if shame be o’er his features spread,</span>
<span class="i0">By his own victim to be soothed and fed;</span>
<span class="i0">But, this inform him, that it is not love</span>
<span class="i0">That prompts my heart, that duties only move.</span>
<span class="i0">Say, that no merits in his favour plead,</span>
<span class="i0">But miseries only, and his abject need;</span>
<span class="i0">Nor bring me grov’ling thanks, nor high-flown praise;</span>
<span class="i0">I would his spirits, not his fancy raise.</span>
<span class="i0">Give him no hope that I shall ever more</span>
<span class="i0">A man so vile to my esteem restore; <span class="linenum">450</span></span>
<span class="i0">But warn him rather, that, in time of rest,</span>
<span class="i0">His crimes be all remember’d and confess’d:</span>
<span class="i0">I know not all that form the sinner’s debt,</span>
<span class="i0">But there is one that he must not forget.”</span>
<span class="i2">The mind of Susan prompted her with speed</span>
<span class="i0">To act her part in every courteous deed:</span>
<span class="i0">All that was kind she was prepared to say,</span>
<span class="i0">And keep the lecture for a future day;</span>
<span class="i0">When he had all life’s comforts by his side,</span>
<span class="i0">Pity might sleep, and good advice be tried. <span class="linenum">460</span></span>
<span class="i2">This done, the mistress felt disposed to look,</span>
<span class="i0">As self-approving, on a pious book:</span>
<span class="i0">Yet, to her native bias still inclined,</span>
<span class="i0">She felt her act too merciful and kind;</span>
<span class="i0">But when, long musing on the chilling scene</span>
<span class="i0">So lately past&mdash;the frost and sleet so keen&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">The man’s whole misery in a single view&mdash;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Yes! she could think some pity was his due.</span>
<span class="i2">Thus fix’d, she heard not her attendant glide</span>
<span class="i0">With soft slow step&mdash;till, standing by her side, <span class="linenum">470</span></span>
<span class="i0">The trembling servant gasp’d for breath, and shed</span>
<span class="i0">Relieving tears, then utter’d&mdash;-“He is dead!”</span>
<span class="i2">“Dead!” said the startled lady; “Yes, he fell</span>
<span class="i0">Close at the door where he was wont to dwell;</span>
<span class="i0">There his sole friend, the ass, was standing by,</span>
<span class="i0">Half-dead himself, to see his master die.”</span>
<span class="i2">“Expired he then, good Heaven! for want of food?”&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“No! crusts and water in a corner stood;&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">To have this plenty, and to wait so long,</span>
<span class="i0">And to be right too late, is doubly wrong: <span class="linenum">480</span></span>
<span class="i0">Then, every day to see him totter by,</span>
<span class="i0">And to forbear&mdash;Oh! what a heart had I!”&mdash;</span>
<span class="i2">“Blame me not, child; I tremble at the news.”&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“’Tis my own heart,” said Susan, “I accuse:</span>
<span class="i0">To have this money in my purse&mdash;to know</span>
<span class="i0">What grief was his, and what to grief we owe;</span>
<span class="i0">To see him often, always to conceive</span>
<span class="i0">How he must pine and languish, groan and grieve;</span>
<span class="i0">And every day in ease and peace to dine</span>
<span class="i0">And rest in comfort!&mdash;what a heart is mine!”&mdash; <span class="linenum">490</span></span>

<p class="f110"><i>THE WAGER.</i></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Counter and Clubb were men in trade, whose pains,</span>
<span class="i0">Credit, and prudence, brought them constant gains;</span>
<span class="i0">Partners and punctual, every friend agreed</span>
<span class="i0">Counter and Clubb were men who must succeed.</span>
<span class="i0">When they had fix’d some little time in life,</span>
<span class="i0">Each thought of taking to himself a wife;</span>
<span class="i0">As men in trade alike, as men in love</span>
<span class="i0">They seem’d with no according views to move;</span>
<span class="i0">As certain ores in outward view the same,</span>
<span class="i0">They show’d their difference when the magnet came. <span class="linenum">10</span></span>
<span class="i0">Counter was vain; with spirit strong and high,</span>
<span class="i0">’Twas not in him like suppliant swain to sigh:</span>
<span class="i0">“His wife might o’er his men and maids preside,</span>
<span class="i0">And in her province be a judge and guide;</span>
<span class="i0">But what he thought, or did, or wish’d to do,</span>
<span class="i0">She must not know, or censure if she knew;</span>
<span class="i0">At home, abroad, by day, by night, if he</span>
<span class="i0">On aught determined, so it was to be.</span>
<span class="i0">How is a man,” he ask’d, “for business fit,</span>
<span class="i0">Who to a female can his will submit? <span class="linenum">20</span></span>
<span class="i0">Absent awhile, let no inquiring eye</span>
<span class="i0">Or plainer speech presume to question why,</span>
<span class="i0">But all be silent; and, when seen again,</span>
<span class="i0">Let all be cheerful&mdash;shall a wife complain?</span>
<span class="i0">Friends I invite, and who shall dare t’ object,</span>
<span class="i0">Or look on them with coolness or neglect?</span>
<span class="i0">No! I must ever of my house be head,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And, thus obey’d, I condescend to wed.”</span>
<span class="i2">Clubb heard the speech&mdash;“My friend is nice,” said he;</span>
<span class="i0">“A wife with less respect will do for me. <span class="linenum">30</span></span>
<span class="i0">How is he certain such a prize to gain?<span class="ws7">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">What he approves, a lass may learn to feign, &emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">And so affect t’ obey till she begins to reign;&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">Awhile complying, she may vary then,</span>
<span class="i0">And be as wives of more unwary men;</span>
<span class="i0">Beside, to him who plays such lordly part,</span>
<span class="i0">How shall a tender creature yield her heart?</span>
<span class="i0">Should he the promised confidence refuse,</span>
<span class="i0">She may another more confiding choose;</span>
<span class="i0">May show her anger, yet her purpose hide, <span class="linenum">40</span></span>
<span class="i0">And wake his jealousy, and wound his pride.</span>
<span class="i0">In one so humbled, who can trace the friend?</span>
<span class="i0">I on an equal, not a slave, depend;</span>
<span class="i0">If true, my confidence is wisely placed,</span>
<span class="i0">And, being false, she only is disgraced.”</span>
<span class="i2">Clubb, with these notions, cast his eye around,</span>
<span class="i0">And one so easy soon a partner found.</span>
<span class="i0">The lady chosen was of good repute;</span>
<span class="i0">Meekness she had not, and was seldom mute;</span>
<span class="i0">Though quick to anger, still she loved to smile; <span class="linenum">50</span></span>
<span class="i0">And would be calm if men would wait awhile:</span>
<span class="i0">She knew her duty, and she loved her way,</span>
<span class="i0">More pleased in truth to govern than obey;</span>
<span class="i0">She heard her priest with reverence, and her spouse</span>
<span class="i0">As one who felt the pressure of her vows.</span>
<span class="i0">Useful and civil, all her friends confess’d&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Give her her way, and she would choose the best;</span>
<span class="i0">Though some indeed a sly remark would make&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Give it her not, and she would choose to take.</span>
<span class="i2">All this, when Clubb some cheerful months had spent, <span class="linenum">60</span></span>
<span class="i0">He saw, confess’d, and said he was content.</span>
<span class="i2">Counter meantime selected, doubted, weigh’d,</span>
<span class="i0">And then brought home a young complying maid&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">A tender creature, full of fears as charms,</span>
<span class="i0">A beauteous nursling from its mother’s arms;</span>
<span class="i0">A soft, sweet blossom, such as men must love,</span>
<span class="i0">But to preserve must keep it in the stove.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
<span class="i0">She had a mild, subdued, expiring look&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Raise but the voice, and this fair creature shook;</span>
<span class="i0">Leave her alone, she felt a thousand fears&mdash; <span class="linenum">70</span></span>
<span class="i0">Chide, and she melted into floods of tears;</span>
<span class="i0">Fondly she pleaded and would gently sigh,</span>
<span class="i0">For very pity, or she knew not why;</span>
<span class="i0">One whom to govern none could be afraid&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Hold up the finger, this meek thing obey’d;</span>
<span class="i0">Her happy husband had the easiest task&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Say but his will, no question would she ask;</span>
<span class="i0">She sought no reasons, no affairs she knew,</span>
<span class="i0">Of business spoke not, and had nought to do.</span>
<span class="i2">Oft he exclaim’d, “How meek! how mild! how kind! <span class="linenum">80</span></span>
<span class="i0">With her ’twere cruel but to seem unkind;</span>
<span class="i0">Though ever silent when I take my leave,</span>
<span class="i0">It pains my heart to think how hers will grieve;</span>
<span class="i0">’Tis heaven on earth with such a wife to dwell,</span>
<span class="i0">I am in raptures to have sped so well;</span>
<span class="i0">But let me not, my friend, your envy raise,</span>
<span class="i0">No! on my life, your patience has my praise.”</span>
<span class="i2">His friend, though silent, felt the scorn implied&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“What need of patience?” to himself he cried:</span>
<span class="i0">“Better a woman o’er her house to rule, <span class="linenum">90</span></span>
<span class="i0">Than a poor child just hurried from her school:</span>
<span class="i0">Who has no care, yet never lives at ease;</span>
<span class="i0">Unfit to rule, and indisposed to please;</span>
<span class="i0">What if he govern, there his boast should end,</span>
<span class="i0">No husband’s power can make a slave his friend.”</span>
<span class="i2">It was the custom of these friends to meet</span>
<span class="i0">With a few neighbours in a neighbouring street;</span>
<span class="i0">Where Counter oft-times would occasion seize,</span>
<span class="i0">To move his silent friend by words like these:</span>
<span class="i0">“A man,” said he, “if govern’d by his wife, <span class="linenum">100</span></span>
<span class="i0">Gives up his rank and dignity in life;</span>
<span class="i0">Now better fate befalls my friend and me.”&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">He spoke, and look’d th’ approving smile to see.</span>
<span class="i2">The quiet partner, when he chose to speak,</span>
<span class="i0">Desired his friend, “another theme to seek;</span>
<span class="i0">When thus they met, he judged that state-affairs</span>
<span class="i0">And such important subjects should be theirs.”</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But still the partner, in his lighter vein,</span>
<span class="i0">Would cause in Clubb affliction or disdain;</span>
<span class="i0">It made him anxious to detect the cause <span class="linenum">110</span></span>
<span class="i0">Of all that boasting&mdash;“Wants my friend applause?</span>
<span class="i0">This plainly proves him not at perfect ease,</span>
<span class="i0">For, felt he pleasure, he would wish to please.&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">These triumphs here for some regrets atone&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Men who are blest let other men alone.”</span>
<span class="i0">Thus made suspicious, he observed and saw</span>
<span class="i0">His friend each night at early hour withdraw;</span>
<span class="i0">He sometimes mention’d Juliet’s tender nerves,</span>
<span class="i0">And what attention such a wife deserves.</span>
<span class="i0">“In this,” thought Clubb, “full sure some mystery lies&mdash;&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">He laughs at me, yet he with much complies,<span class="ws11">}</span><span class="linenum">121</span></span>
<span class="i0">And all his vaunts of bliss are proud apologies.” <span class="ws8">}</span></span>
<span class="i2">With such ideas treasured in his breast,</span>
<span class="i0">He grew composed, and let his anger rest;</span>
<span class="i0">Till Counter once (when wine so long went round</span>
<span class="i0">That friendship and discretion both were drown’d)</span>
<span class="i0">Began in teasing and triumphant mood</span>
<span class="i0">His evening banter&mdash;“Of all earthly good,</span>
<span class="i0">The best,” he said, “was an obedient spouse,</span>
<span class="i0">Such as my friend’s&mdash;that every one allows: <span class="linenum">130</span></span>
<span class="i0">What if she wishes his designs to know?</span>
<span class="i0">It is because she would her praise bestow;</span>
<span class="i0">What if she wills that he remains at home?</span>
<span class="i0">She knows that mischief may from travel come.</span>
<span class="i0">I, who am free to venture where I please,</span>
<span class="i0">Have no such kind preventing checks as these;</span>
<span class="i0">But mine is double duty, first to guide</span>
<span class="i0">Myself aright, then rule a house beside;</span>
<span class="i0">While this our friend, more happy than the free,</span>
<span class="i0">Resigns all power, and laughs at liberty.” <span class="linenum">140</span></span>
<span class="i2">“By Heaven,” said Clubb, “excuse me if I swear,</span>
<span class="i0">I’ll bet a hundred guineas, if he dare,</span>
<span class="i0">That uncontroll’d I will such freedoms take,</span>
<span class="i0">That he will fear to equal&mdash;there’s my stake.”</span>
<span class="i2">“A match!” said Counter, much by wine inflamed;</span>
<span class="i0">“But we are friends&mdash;let smaller stake be named:</span>
<span class="i0">Wine for our future meeting, that will I</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Take and no more&mdash;what peril shall we try?”</span>
<span class="i0">“Let’s to Newmarket,” Clubb replied; “or choose</span>
<span class="i0">Yourself the place, and what you like to lose; <span class="linenum">150</span></span>
<span class="i0">And he who first returns, or fears to go,</span>
<span class="i0">Forfeits his cash.”&mdash;Said Counter, “Be it so.”</span>
<span class="i2">The friends around them saw with much delight</span>
<span class="i0">The social war, and hail’d the pleasant night;</span>
<span class="i0">Nor would they further hear the cause discuss’d,</span>
<span class="i0">Afraid the recreant heart of Clubb to trust.</span>
<span class="i2">Now sober thoughts return’d as each withdrew,</span>
<span class="i0">And of the subject took a serious view.</span>
<span class="i0">“’Twas wrong,” thought Counter, “and will grieve my love;”</span>
<span class="i0">“’Twas wrong,” thought Clubb, “my wife will not approve;</span>
<span class="i0">But friends were present; I must try the thing, <span class="linenum">161</span></span>
<span class="i0">Or with my folly half the town will ring.”</span>
<span class="i2">He sought his lady&mdash;“Madam, I’m to blame,</span>
<span class="i0">But was reproach’d, and could not bear the shame;</span>
<span class="i0">Here in my folly&mdash;for ’tis best to say</span>
<span class="i0">The very truth&mdash;I’ve sworn to have my way:</span>
<span class="i0">To that Newmarket&mdash;(though I hate the place,</span>
<span class="i0">And have no taste or talents for a race,</span>
<span class="i0">Yet so it is&mdash;well, now prepare to chide&mdash;)</span>
<span class="i0">I laid a wager that I dared to ride; <span class="linenum">170</span></span>
<span class="i0">And I must go: by Heaven, if you resist</span>
<span class="i0">I shall be scorn’d, and ridiculed, and hiss’d;</span>
<span class="i0">Let me with grace before my friends appear,</span>
<span class="i0">You know the truth, and must not be severe;</span>
<span class="i0">He too must go, but that he will of course;</span>
<span class="i0">Do you consent?&mdash;I never think of force.”</span>
<span class="i2">“You never need,” the worthy dame replied;</span>
<span class="i0">“The husband’s honour is the woman’s pride;</span>
<span class="i0">If I in trifles be the wilful wife,</span>
<span class="i0">Still for your credit I would lose my life; <span class="linenum">180</span></span>
<span class="i0">Go! and when fix’d the day of your return,</span>
<span class="i0">Stay longer yet, and let the blockheads learn,</span>
<span class="i0">That, though a wife may sometimes wish to rule,</span>
<span class="i0">She would not make th’ indulgent man a fool;</span>
<span class="i0">I would at times advise&mdash;but idle they</span>
<span class="i0">Who think th’ assenting husband <i>must</i> obey.”</span>
<span class="i2">The happy man, who thought his lady right</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
<span class="i0">In other cases, was assured to-night;</span>
<span class="i0">Then for the day with proud delight prepared,</span>
<span class="i0">To show his doubting friends how much he dared. <span class="linenum">190</span></span>
<span class="i2">Counter&mdash;who grieving sought his bed, his rest</span>
<span class="i0">Broken by pictures of his love distress’d&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">With soft and winning speech the fair prepared:</span>
<span class="i0">“She all his councils, comforts, pleasures shared;</span>
<span class="i0">She was assured he loved her from his soul;</span>
<span class="i0">She never knew and need not fear control;</span>
<span class="i0">But so it happen’d&mdash;he was grieved at heart,</span>
<span class="i0">It happen’d so, that they awhile must part&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">A little time&mdash;the distance was but short,</span>
<span class="i0">And business call’d him&mdash;he despised the sport; <span class="linenum">200</span></span>
<span class="i0">But to Newmarket he engaged to ride,</span>
<span class="i0">With his friend Clubb;” and there he stopp’d and sigh’d.</span>
<span class="i2">Awhile the tender creature look’d dismay’d,</span>
<span class="i0">Then floods of tears the call of grief obey’d:&mdash;</span>
<span class="i2">“She an objection! No!” she sobb’d, “not one;</span>
<span class="i0">Her work was finish’d, and her race was run;</span>
<span class="i0">For die she must, indeed she would not live</span>
<span class="i0">A week alone, for all the world could give;</span>
<span class="i0">He too must die in that same wicked place;</span>
<span class="i0">It always happen’d&mdash;was a common case; <span class="linenum">210</span></span>
<span class="i0">Among those horrid horses, jockeys, crowds,</span>
<span class="i0">’Twas certain death&mdash;they might bespeak their shrouds;</span>
<span class="i0">He would attempt a race, be sure to fall&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">And she expire with terror&mdash;that was all;</span>
<span class="i0">With love like hers she was indeed unfit</span>
<span class="i0">To bear such horrors, but she must submit.”&mdash;</span>
<span class="i2">“But for three days, my love! three days at most&mdash;”</span>
<span class="i0">“Enough for me; I then shall be a ghost.&mdash;”</span>
<span class="i0">“My honour’s pledged!”&mdash;“Oh! yes, my dearest life,</span>
<span class="i0">I know your honour must outweigh your wife; <span class="linenum">220</span></span>
<span class="i0">But ere this absence, have you sought a friend&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">I shall be dead&mdash;on whom can you depend?&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Let me one favour of your kindness crave:</span>
<span class="i0">Grant me the stone I mention’d for my grave.&mdash;”</span>
<span class="i2">“Nay, love, attend&mdash;why, bless my soul&mdash;I say</span>
<span class="i0">I will return&mdash;there&mdash;weep no longer&mdash;nay!”&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“Well! I obey, and to the last am true,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But spirits fail me; I must die; adieu!”</span>
<span class="i2">“What, madam! must?&mdash;’tis wrong&mdash;I’m angry&mdash;zounds!</span>
<span class="i0">Can I remain and lose a thousand pounds?” <span class="linenum">230</span></span>
<span class="i2">“Go then, my love! it is a monstrous sum,</span>
<span class="i0">Worth twenty wives&mdash;go, love! and I am dumb&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Nor be displeased&mdash;[had] I the power to live,</span>
<span class="i0">You might be angry, now you must forgive;</span>
<span class="i0">Alas! I faint&mdash;ah! cruel&mdash;there’s no need</span>
<span class="i0">Of wounds or fevers&mdash;this had done the deed.”</span>
<span class="i2">The lady fainted, and the husband sent</span>
<span class="i0">For every aid, for every comfort went;</span>
<span class="i0">Strong terror seized him; “Oh! she loved so well,</span>
<span class="i0">And who th’ effect of tenderness could tell?” <span class="linenum">240</span></span>
<span class="i2">She now recover’d, and again began</span>
<span class="i0">With accent querulous&mdash;“Ah! cruel man&mdash;”</span>
<span class="i0">Till the sad husband, conscience-struck, confess’d,</span>
<span class="i0">’Twas very wicked with his friend to jest;</span>
<span class="i0">For now he saw that those who were obey’d,</span>
<span class="i0">Could like the most subservient feel afraid;</span>
<span class="i0">And, though a wife might not dispute the will</span>
<span class="i0">Of her liege lord, she could prevent it still.</span>
<span class="i2">The morning came, and Clubb prepared to ride</span>
<span class="i0">With a smart boy, his servant and his guide; <span class="linenum">250</span></span>
<span class="i0">When, ere he mounted on the ready steed,</span>
<span class="i0">Arrived a letter, and he stopp’d to read.</span>
<span class="i2">“My friend,” he read&mdash;“our journey I decline:</span>
<span class="i0">A heart too tender for such strife is mine;</span>
<span class="i0">Yours is the triumph, be you so inclined;</span>
<span class="i0">But you are too considerate and kind,</span>
<span class="i0">In tender pity to my Juliet’s fears</span>
<span class="i0">I thus relent, o’ercome by love and tears;</span>
<span class="i0">She knows your kindness; I have heard her say,</span>
<span class="i0">A man like you ’tis pleasure to obey. <span class="linenum">260</span></span>
<span class="i0">Each faithful wife, like ours, must disapprove</span>
<span class="i0">Such dangerous trifling with connubial love;</span>
<span class="i0">What has the idle world, my friend, to do</span>
<span class="i0">With our affairs? they envy me and you.</span>
<span class="i0">What if I could my gentle spouse command&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Is that a cause I should her tears withstand?</span>
<span class="i0">And what if you, a friend of peace, submit</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
<span class="i0">To one you love&mdash;is that a theme for wit?</span>
<span class="i0">’Twas wrong; and I shall henceforth judge it weak</span>
<span class="i0">Both of submission and control to speak. <span class="linenum">270</span></span>
<span class="i0">Be it agreed that all contention cease,</span>
<span class="i0">And no such follies vex our future peace;</span>
<span class="i0">Let each keep guard against domestic strife,</span>
<span class="i0">And find nor slave nor tyrant in his wife.”</span>
<span class="i2">“Agreed,” said Clubb, “with all my soul agreed”&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">And to the boy, delighted, gave his steed;</span>
<span class="i0">“I think my friend has well his mind express’d,</span>
<span class="i0">And I assent; such things are not a jest.”</span>
<span class="i2">“True,” said the wife, “no longer he can hide</span>
<span class="i0">The truth that pains him by his wounded pride. <span class="linenum">280</span></span>
<span class="i0">Your friend has found it not an easy thing,</span>
<span class="i0">Beneath his yoke this yielding soul to bring;</span>
<span class="i0">These weeping willows, though they seem inclined<span class="ws6">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">By every breeze, yet not the strongest wind<span class="ws12">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Can from their bent divert this weak but stubborn kind; &emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">Drooping they seek your pity to excite,</span>
<span class="i0">But ’tis at once their nature and delight.</span>
<span class="i0">Such women feel not; while they sigh and weep,</span>
<span class="i0">’Tis but their habit&mdash;their affections sleep;</span>
<span class="i0">They are like ice that in the hand we hold, <span class="linenum">290</span></span>
<span class="i0">So very melting, yet so very cold;</span>
<span class="i0">On such affection let not man rely:</span>
<span class="i0">The husbands suffer, and the ladies sigh.</span>
<span class="i0">But your friend’s offer let us kindly take,</span>
<span class="i0">And spare his pride for his vexation’s sake;</span>
<span class="i0">For he has found, and through his life will find, <span class="ws10">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">’Tis easiest dealing with the firmest mind&mdash;<span class="ws13">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">More just when it resists, and, when it yields, more kind.”&emsp;}</span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Some to our hero have a hero’s name</span>
<span class="i0">Denied, because no father’s he could claim;</span>
<span class="i0">Nor could his mother with precision state</span>
<span class="i0">A full fair claim to her certificate;</span>
<span class="i0">On her own word the marriage must depend&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">A point she was not eager to defend.</span>
<span class="i0">But who, without a father’s name, can raise</span>
<span class="i0">His own so high, deserves the greater praise:</span>
<span class="i0">The less advantage to the strife he brought,</span>
<span class="i0">The greater wonders has his prowess wrought; <span class="linenum">10</span></span>
<span class="i0">He who depends upon his wind and limbs,</span>
<span class="i0">Needs neither cork or bladder when he swims;</span>
<span class="i0">Nor will by empty breath be puff’d along,</span>
<span class="i0">As not himself&mdash;but in his helpers&mdash;strong.</span>
<span class="i2">Suffice it then, our hero’s name was clear,</span>
<span class="i0">For, call John Dighton, and he answer’d, “Here!”</span>
<span class="i0">But who that name in early life assign’d</span>
<span class="i0">He never found, he never tried to find;</span>
<span class="i0">Whether his kindred were to John disgrace,</span>
<span class="i0">Or John to them, is a disputed case; <span class="linenum">20</span></span>
<span class="i0">His infant-state owed nothing to their care&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">His mind neglected, and his body bare;</span>
<span class="i0">All his success must on himself depend,</span>
<span class="i0">He had no money, counsel, guide, or friend;</span>
<span class="i0">But, in a market-town, an active boy</span>
<span class="i0">Appear’d, and sought in various ways employ;</span>
<span class="i0">Who soon, thus cast upon the world, began</span>
<span class="i0">To show the talents of a thriving man.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
<span class="i2">With spirit high John learn’d the world to brave,</span>
<span class="i0">And in both senses was a ready knave; <span class="linenum">30</span></span>
<span class="i0">Knave [as of] old, obedient, keen, and quick,</span>
<span class="i0">Knave as at present, skill’d to shift and trick.</span>
<span class="i0">Some humble part of many trades he caught:</span>
<span class="i0">He for the builder and the painter wrought;</span>
<span class="i0">For serving-maids on secret errands ran,</span>
<span class="i0">The waiter’s helper, and the hostler’s man;</span>
<span class="i0">And, when he chanced (oft chanced he) place to lose,</span>
<span class="i0">His varying genius shone in blacking shoes.</span>
<span class="i0">A midnight fisher by the pond he stood;</span>
<span class="i0">Assistant poacher, he o’erlook’d the wood; <span class="linenum">40</span></span>
<span class="i0">At an election John’s impartial mind</span>
<span class="i0">Was to no cause nor candidate confined;</span>
<span class="i0">To all in turn he full allegiance swore,</span>
<span class="i0">And in his hat the various badges bore;</span>
<span class="i0">His liberal soul with every sect agreed;</span>
<span class="i0">Unheard their reasons, he received their creed.</span>
<span class="i0">At church he deign’d the organ-pipes to fill,</span>
<span class="i0">And at the meeting sang both loud and shrill;</span>
<span class="i0">But the full purse these different merits gain’d,</span>
<span class="i0">By strong demands his lively passions drain’d; <span class="linenum">50</span></span>
<span class="i0">Liquors he loved of each inflaming kind,</span>
<span class="i0">To midnight revels flew with ardent mind;</span>
<span class="i0">Too warm at cards, a losing game he play’d;</span>
<span class="i0">To fleecing beauty his attention paid;</span>
<span class="i0">His boiling passions were by oaths express’d,</span>
<span class="i0">And lies he made his profit and his jest.</span>
<span class="i2">Such was the boy, and such the man had been,</span>
<span class="i0">But fate or happier fortune changed the scene;</span>
<span class="i0">A fever seized him; “he should surely die&mdash;”</span>
<span class="i0">He fear’d, and lo! a friend was praying by. <span class="linenum">60</span></span>
<span class="i0">With terror moved, this teacher he address’d,</span>
<span class="i0">And all the errors of his youth confess’d:</span>
<span class="i0">The good man kindly clear’d the sinner’s way</span>
<span class="i0">To lively hope, and counsell’d him to pray:</span>
<span class="i0">Who then resolved, should he from sickness rise,</span>
<span class="i0">To quit cards, liquors, poaching, oaths, and lies.</span>
<span class="i0">His health restored, he yet resolved, and grew</span>
<span class="i0">True to his masters, to their meeting true;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
<span class="i0">His old companions at his sober face <span class="ws14">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Laugh’d loud, while he, attesting it was grace,<span class="ws7">}</span><span class="linenum">70</span></span>
<span class="i0">With tears besought them all his calling to embrace. &emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">To his new friends such convert gave applause,</span>
<span class="i0">Life to their zeal, and glory to their cause;</span>
<span class="i0">Though terror wrought the mighty change, yet strong</span>
<span class="i0">Was the impression, and it lasted long;</span>
<span class="i0">John at the lectures due attendance paid,</span>
<span class="i0">A convert meek, obedient, and afraid.</span>
<span class="i0">His manners strict, though form’d on fear alone, <span class="ws7">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Pleased the grave friends, nor less his solemn tone, <span class="ws5">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">The lengthen’d face of care, the low and inward groan.&nbsp;&emsp;}<span class="linenum">80</span></span>
<span class="i0">The stern good men exulted, when they saw</span>
<span class="i0">Those timid looks of penitence and awe;</span>
<span class="i0">Nor thought that one so passive, humble, meek,</span>
<span class="i0">Had yet a creed and principles to seek.</span>
<span class="i2">The faith that reason finds, confirms, avows,</span>
<span class="i0">The hopes, the views, the comforts she allows&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">These were not his, who by his feelings found,</span>
<span class="i0">And by them only, that his faith was sound:</span>
<span class="i0">Feelings of terror these, for evil past,</span>
<span class="i0">Feelings of hope, to be received at last; <span class="linenum">90</span></span>
<span class="i0">Now weak, now lively, changing with the day,</span>
<span class="i0">These were his feelings, and he felt his way.</span>
<span class="i2">Sprung from such sources, will this faith remain</span>
<span class="i0">While these supporters can their strength retain?</span>
<span class="i0">As heaviest weights the deepest rivers pass,</span>
<span class="i0">While icy chains fast bind the solid mass:</span>
<span class="i0">So, born of feelings, faith remains secure,</span>
<span class="i0">Long as their firmness and their strength endure;</span>
<span class="i0">But, when the waters in their channel glide,</span>
<span class="i0">A bridge must bear us o’er the threat’ning tide; <span class="linenum">100</span></span>
<span class="i0">Such bridge is reason, and there faith relies,</span>
<span class="i0">Whether the varying spirits fall or rise.</span>
<span class="i2">His patrons, still disposed their aid to lend,</span>
<span class="i0">Behind a counter placed their humble friend;</span>
<span class="i0">Where pens and paper were on shelves display’d,</span>
<span class="i0">And pious pamphlets on the windows laid.</span>
<span class="i0">By nature active, and from vice restrain’d,</span>
<span class="i0">Increasing trade his bolder views sustain’d;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
<span class="i0">His friends and teachers, finding so much zeal</span>
<span class="i0">In that young convert whom they taught to feel, <span class="linenum">110</span></span>
<span class="i0">His trade encouraged, and were pleased to find</span>
<span class="i0">A hand so ready, with such humble mind.</span>
<span class="i2">And now, his health restored, his spirits eased,</span>
<span class="i0">He wish’d to marry, if the teachers pleased.</span>
<span class="i0">They, not unwilling, from the virgin-class</span>
<span class="i0">Took him a comely and a courteous lass;</span>
<span class="i0">Simple and civil, loving and beloved,</span>
<span class="i0">She long a fond and faithful partner proved;</span>
<span class="i0">In every year the elders and the priest</span>
<span class="i0">Were duly summon’d to a christening feast; <span class="linenum">120</span></span>
<span class="i0">Nor came a babe, but by his growing trade,</span>
<span class="i0">John had provision for the coming made;</span>
<span class="i0">For friends and strangers all were pleased to deal</span>
<span class="i0">With one whose care was equal to his zeal.</span>
<span class="i2">In human friendships, it compels a sigh,</span>
<span class="i0">To think what trifles will dissolve the tie.</span>
<span class="i0">John, now become a master of his trade,</span>
<span class="i0">Perceived how much improvement might be made;</span>
<span class="i0">And, as this prospect open’d to his view,</span>
<span class="i0">A certain portion of his zeal withdrew; <span class="linenum">130</span></span>
<span class="i0">His fear abated&mdash;“What had he to fear&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">His profits certain, and his conscience clear?”</span>
<span class="i0">Above his door a board was placed by John,</span>
<span class="i0">And “Dighton, stationer,” was gilt thereon;</span>
<span class="i0">His window next, enlarged to twice the size,</span>
<span class="i0">Shone with such trinkets as the simple prize;</span>
<span class="i0">While in the shop with pious works were seen</span>
<span class="i0">The last new play, review, or magazine.</span>
<span class="i0">In orders punctual, he observed&mdash;“The books</span>
<span class="i0">He never read, and could he judge their looks? <span class="linenum">140</span></span>
<span class="i0">Readers and critics should their merits try,</span>
<span class="i0">He had no office but to sell and buy;</span>
<span class="i0">Like other traders, profit was his care;</span>
<span class="i0">Of what they print, the authors must beware.”</span>
<span class="i0">He held his patrons and his teachers dear,</span>
<span class="i0">But with his trade&mdash;they must not interfere.</span>
<span class="i2">’Twas certain now that John had lost the dread</span>
<span class="i0">And pious thoughts that once such terrors bred;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
<span class="i0">His habits varied, and he more inclined</span>
<span class="i0">To the vain world, which he had half resign’d: <span class="linenum">150</span></span>
<span class="i0">He had moreover in his brethren seen,</span>
<span class="i0">Or he imagined, craft, conceit, and spleen;</span>
<span class="i0">“They are but men,” said John, “and shall I then</span>
<span class="i0">Fear man’s control, or stand in awe of men?</span>
<span class="i0">’Tis their advice (their convert’s rule and law),</span>
<span class="i0">And good it is&mdash;I will not stand in awe.”</span>
<span class="i2">Moreover Dighton, though he thought of books</span>
<span class="i0">As one who chiefly on the title looks,</span>
<span class="i0">Yet sometimes ponder’d o’er a page to find,</span>
<span class="i0">When vex’d with cares, amusement for his mind; <span class="linenum">160</span></span>
<span class="i0">And by degrees that mind had treasured much</span>
<span class="i0">From works his teachers were afraid to touch.</span>
<span class="i0">Satiric novels, poets bold and free,</span>
<span class="i0">And what their writers term philosophy,</span>
<span class="i0">All these were read; and he began to feel</span>
<span class="i0">Some self-approval on his bosom steal.</span>
<span class="i0">Wisdom creates humility, but he</span>
<span class="i0">Who thus collects it, will not humble be.</span>
<span class="i0">No longer John was fill’d with pure delight</span>
<span class="i0">And humble reverence in a pastor’s sight, <span class="linenum">170</span></span>
<span class="i0">Who, like a grateful zealot, listening stood,</span>
<span class="i0">To hear a man so friendly and so good;</span>
<span class="i0">But felt the dignity of one who made</span>
<span class="i0">Himself important by a thriving trade;</span>
<span class="i0">And growing pride in Dighton’s mind was bred</span>
<span class="i0">By the strange food on which it coarsely fed.</span>
<span class="i2">Their brother’s fall the grieving brethren heard,</span>
<span class="i0">The pride indeed to all around appear’d;</span>
<span class="i0">The world, his friends agreed, had won the soul</span>
<span class="i0">From its best hopes, the man from their control. <span class="linenum">180</span></span>
<span class="i0">To make him humble, and confine his views</span>
<span class="i0">Within their bounds, and books which they peruse,</span>
<span class="i0">A deputation from these friends select,</span>
<span class="i0">Might reason with him to some good effect;</span>
<span class="i0">Arm’d with authority, and led by love,</span>
<span class="i0">They might those follies from his mind remove;</span>
<span class="i0">Deciding thus, and with this kind intent,</span>
<span class="i0">A chosen body with its speaker went.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
<span class="i2">“John,” said the teacher, “John, with great concern</span>

<span class="i0">Thee on the sabbath seldom we behold;</span>
<span class="i0">Thou canst not sing, thou’rt nursing for a cold:</span>

<span class="i0">By what strange names dost thou these baubles know,</span>
<span class="i0">Which wantons wear, to make a sinful show?</span>
<span class="i0">Hast thou in view these idle volumes placed</span>

<span class="i0">Wretch as thou art, what answer canst thou make?</span>
<span class="i0">Oh! without question, thou wilt go and shake.</span>
<span class="i0">What’s here? ‘The School for Scandal’&mdash;pretty schools!</span>
<span class="i0">Well, and art thou proficient in the rules?</span>
<span class="i0">Art thou a pupil, is it thy design</span>
<span class="i0">To make our names contemptible as thine?</span>

<span class="i0">‘Frolic and Fun,’ ‘The humours of Tim Grin’;</span>

<span class="i0">If Satan publish’d, thou wouldst doubtless sell;</span>
<span class="i0">Jests, novels, dances, and this precious stuff&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">To crown thy folly we have seen enough;</span>

<span class="i2">“John, thou art lost; success and worldly pride&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">O’er all thy thoughts and purposes preside, <span class="ws6">}</span><span class="linenum">230</span></span>
<span class="i0">Have bound thee fast, and drawn thee far aside;<span class="ws3">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Yet turn, these sin-traps from thy shop expel,</span>

<span class="i0">What? ’tis a cross; come hither&mdash;as a friend, <span class="linenum">240</span></span>
<span class="i0">Thus from thy neck the shameful badge I rend.”</span>

<span class="i0">I thought you saints on earth&mdash;but I have found</span>
<span class="i0">Some sins among you, and the best unsound;</span>
<span class="i0">You have your failings, like the crowds below,</span>

<span class="i0">I should have thought it treason to rebel.</span>
<span class="i0">Is it a wonder that a man like me</span>
<span class="i0">Should such perfection in such teachers see;</span>
<span class="i0">Nay, should conceive you sent from Heav’n to brave</span>
<span class="i0">The host of sin, and sinful souls to save?</span>
<span class="i0">But, as our reason wakes, our prospects clear,</span>
<span class="i0">And failings, flaws, and blemishes appear.</span>
<span class="i2">“When you were mounted in your rostrum high, <span class="linenum">280</span></span>
<span class="i0">We shrank beneath your tone, your frown, your eye;</span>
<span class="i0">Then you beheld us abject, fallen, low,</span>
<span class="i0">And felt your glory from our baseness grow;</span>
<span class="i0">Touch’d by your words, I trembled like the rest,</span>
<span class="i0">And my own vileness and your power confess’d:</span>
<span class="i0">These, I exclaim’d, are men divine, and gazed</span>
<span class="i0">On him who taught, delighted and amazed;</span>
<span class="i0">Glad, when he finish’d, if by chance he cast</span>

<span class="i0">When, as you sat contented and at ease,</span>
<span class="i0">Nibbling at leisure on the ducks and peas,</span>
<span class="i0">And, pleased some comforts in such place to find,</span>
<span class="i0">You could descend to be a little kind;</span>
<span class="i0">And gave us hope, in Heaven there might be room</span>
<span class="i0">For a few souls beside your own to come;</span>
<span class="i0">While this world’s good engaged your carnal view, <span class="linenum">300</span></span>
<span class="i0">And like a sinner you enjoy’d it too:</span>
<span class="i0">All this perceiving, can you think it strange</span>
<span class="i0">That change in you should work an equal change?”</span>
<span class="i2">“Wretch that thou art,” an elder cried, “and gone</span>
<span class="i0">For everlasting”&mdash;&mdash;“Go thyself,” said John;</span>
<span class="i0">“Depart this instant, let me hear no more;</span>
<span class="i0">My house my castle is, and that my door.”</span>
<span class="i2">The hint they took, and from the door withdrew,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And John to meeting bade a long adieu;</span>
<span class="i0">Attach’d to business; he in time became <span class="linenum">310</span></span>
<span class="i0">A wealthy man of no inferior name.</span>
<span class="i0">It seem’d, alas! in John’s deluded sight,</span>
<span class="i0">That all was wrong because not all was right;</span>
<span class="i0">And, when he found his teachers had their stains,</span>
<span class="i0">Resentment and not reason broke his chains.</span>
<span class="i0">Thus on his feelings he again relied,</span>
<span class="i0">And never look’d to reason for his guide.</span>
<span class="i0">Could he have wisely view’d the frailty shown,</span>
<span class="i0">And rightly weigh’d their wanderings and his own,</span>
<span class="i0">He might have known that men may be sincere, <span class="linenum">320</span></span>
<span class="i0">Though gay and feasting on the savoury cheer;</span>
<span class="i0">That doctrines sound and sober they may teach,</span>
<span class="i0">Who love to eat with all the glee they preach;</span>
<span class="i0">Nay, who believe the duck, the grape, the pine,</span>
<span class="i0">Were not intended for the dog and swine.</span>
<span class="i0">But Dighton’s hasty mind on every theme</span>
<span class="i0">Ran from the truth, and rested in th’ extreme;</span>
<span class="i0">Flaws in his friends he found, and then withdrew</span>
<span class="i0">(Vain of his knowledge) from their virtues too;</span>
<span class="i0">Best of his books he loved the liberal kind, <span class="linenum">330</span></span>
<span class="i0">That, if they improve not, still enlarge the mind;</span>
<span class="i0">And found himself, with such advisers, free</span>
<span class="i0">From a fix’d creed, as mind enlarged could be.</span>
<span class="i0">His humble wife at these opinions sigh’d,</span>
<span class="i0">But her he never heeded till she died;</span>
<span class="i0">He then assented to a last request,</span>
<span class="i0">And by the meeting-window let her rest;</span>
<span class="i0">And on her stone the sacred text was seen,</span>
<span class="i0">Which had her comfort in departing been.</span>
<span class="i2">Dighton with joy beheld his trade advance, <span class="linenum">340</span></span>
<span class="i0">Yet seldom published, loth to trust to chance;</span>
<span class="i0">Then wed a doctor’s sister&mdash;poor indeed,</span>
<span class="i0">But skill’d in works her husband could not read;</span>
<span class="i0">Who, if he wish’d new ways of wealth to seek,</span>
<span class="i0">Could make her half-crown pamphlet in a week:</span>
<span class="i0">This he rejected, though without disdain,</span>
<span class="i0">And chose the old and certain way to gain.</span>
<span class="i2">Thus he proceeded; trade increased the while,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And fortune woo’d him with perpetual smile.</span>
<span class="i0">On early scenes he sometimes cast a thought, <span class="linenum">350</span></span>
<span class="i0">When on his heart the mighty change was wrought;</span>
<span class="i0">And all the ease and comfort converts find</span>
<span class="i0">Was magnified in his reflecting mind;</span>
<span class="i0">Then on the teacher’s priestly pride he dwelt,</span>
<span class="i0">That caused his freedom, but with this he felt</span>
<span class="i0">The danger of the free&mdash;for since that day,</span>
<span class="i0">No guide had shown, no brethren join’d his way;</span>
<span class="i0">Forsaking one, he found no second creed,</span>
<span class="i0">But reading doubted, doubting what to read.</span>
<span class="i2">Still, though reproof had brought some present pain, <span class="linenum">360</span></span>
<span class="i0">The gain he made was fair and honest gain;</span>
<span class="i0">He laid his wares indeed in public view,</span>
<span class="i0">But that all traders claim a right to do.</span>
<span class="i0">By means like these, he saw his wealth increase,</span>
<span class="i0">And felt his consequence, and dwelt in peace.</span>
<span class="i2">Our hero’s age was threescore years and five,</span>
<span class="i0">When he exclaim’d, “Why longer should I strive?</span>
<span class="i0">Why more amass, who never must behold</span>
<span class="i0">A young John Dighton to make glad the old?”</span>
<span class="i0">(The sons he had to early graves were gone, <span class="linenum">370</span></span>
<span class="i0">And girls were burdens to the mind of John.)</span>
<span class="i0">“Had I [a] boy, he would our name sustain,</span>
<span class="i0">That now to nothing must return again;</span>
<span class="i0">But what are all my profits, credit, trade,</span>
<span class="i0">And parish-honours?&mdash;folly and parade.”</span>
<span class="i2">Thus Dighton thought, and in his looks appear’d</span>
<span class="i0">Sadness, increased by much he saw and heard.</span>
<span class="i0">The brethren often at the shop would stay,</span>
<span class="i0">And make their comments ere they walk’d away;</span>
<span class="i0">They mark’d the window, fill’d in every pane <span class="linenum">380</span></span>
<span class="i0">With lawless prints of reputations slain;</span>
<span class="i0">Distorted forms of men with honours graced,</span>
<span class="i0">And our chief rulers in derision placed:</span>
<span class="i0">Amazed they stood, remembering well the days,</span>
<span class="i0">When to be humble was their brother’s praise;</span>
<span class="i0">When at the dwelling of their friend they stopp’d</span>
<span class="i0">To drop a word, or to receive it dropp’d;</span>
<span class="i0">Where they beheld the prints of men renown’d,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And far-famed preachers pasted all around;</span>
<span class="i0">(Such mouths! eyes! hair! so prim! so fierce! so sleek! <span class="linenum">390</span></span>
<span class="i0">They look’d as speaking what is wo to speak):</span>
<span class="i0">On these the passing brethren loved to dwell&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">How long they spake! how strongly! warmly! well!</span>
<span class="i0">What power had each to dive in mysteries deep,</span>
<span class="i0">To warm the cold, to make the harden’d weep;</span>
<span class="i0">To lure, to fright, to soothe, to awe the soul,</span>
<span class="i0">And list’ning flocks to lead and to control!</span>
<span class="i2">But now discoursing, as they linger’d near,</span>
<span class="i0">They tempted John (whom they accused) to hear</span>
<span class="i0">Their weighty charge&mdash;“And can the lost-one feel, <span class="linenum">400</span></span>
<span class="i0">As in the time of duty, love, and zeal:</span>
<span class="i0">When all were summon’d at the rising sun,</span>
<span class="i0">And he was ready with his friends to run;</span>
<span class="i0">When he, partaking with a chosen few,</span>
<span class="i0">Felt the great change, sensation rich and new?</span>
<span class="i0">No! all is lost, her favours Fortune shower’d</span>
<span class="i0">Upon the man, and he is overpower’d;</span>
<span class="i0">The world has won him with its tempting store</span>
<span class="i0">Of needless wealth, and that has made him poor.</span>
<span class="i0">Success undoes him; he has risen to fall, <span class="linenum">410</span></span>
<span class="i0">Has gain’d a fortune, and has lost his all;</span>
<span class="i0">Gone back from Sion, he will find his age</span>
<span class="i0">Loth to commence a second pilgrimage;</span>
<span class="i0">He has retreated from the chosen track;</span>
<span class="i0">And now must ever bear the burden on his back.”</span>
<span class="i2">Hurt by such censure, John began to find</span>
<span class="i0">Fresh revolutions working in his mind;</span>
<span class="i0">He sought for comfort in his books, but read</span>
<span class="i0">Without a plan or method in his head;</span>
<span class="i0">What once amused, now rather made him sad, <span class="linenum">420</span></span>
<span class="i0">What should inform, increased the doubts he had;</span>
<span class="i0">Shame would not let him seek at church a guide,</span>
<span class="i0">And from his meeting he was held by pride;</span>
<span class="i0">His wife derided fears she never felt,</span>
<span class="i0">And passing brethren daily censures dealt;</span>
<span class="i0">Hope for a son was now for ever past,</span>
<span class="i0">He was the first John Dighton, and the last;</span>
<span class="i0">His stomach fail’d, his case the doctor knew,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But said, “he still might hold a year or two.”</span>
<span class="i0">“No more?” he said, “but why should I complain? <span class="linenum">430</span></span>
<span class="i0">A life of doubt must be a life of pain.</span>
<span class="i0">Could I be sure&mdash;but why should I despair?</span>
<span class="i0">I’m sure my conduct has been just and fair;</span>
<span class="i0">In youth indeed I had a wicked will,</span>
<span class="i0">But I repented, and have sorrow still;</span>
<span class="i0">I had my comforts, and a growing trade</span>
<span class="i0">Gave greater pleasure than a fortune made;</span>
<span class="i0">And, as I more possess’d and reason’d more,</span>
<span class="i0">I lost those comforts I enjoy’d before,</span>
<span class="i0">When reverend guides I saw my table round, <span class="linenum">440</span></span>
<span class="i0">And in my guardian guest my safety found.</span>
<span class="i0">Now sick and sad, no appetite, no ease,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor pleasure have I, nor a wish to please;</span>
<span class="i0">Nor views, nor hopes, nor plans, nor taste have I,</span>
<span class="i0">Yet sick of life, have no desire to die.”</span>
<span class="i2">He said, and died; his trade, his name is gone,</span>
<span class="i0">And all that once gave consequence to John.</span>
<span class="i2">Unhappy Dighton! had he found a friend,</span>
<span class="i0">When conscience told him it was time to mend!</span>
<span class="i0">A friend discreet, considerate, kind, sincere, <span class="linenum">450</span></span>
<span class="i0">Who would have shown the grounds of hope and fear;</span>
<span class="i0">And proved that spirits, whether high or low,</span>
<span class="i0">No certain tokens of man’s safety show;</span>
<span class="i0">Had reason ruled him in her proper place,</span>
<span class="i0">And virtue led him while he lean’d on grace;</span>
<span class="i0">Had he while zealous been discreet and pure,</span>
<span class="i0">His knowledge humble, and his hope secure&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">These guides had placed him on the solid rock,</span>
<span class="i0">Where faith had rested, nor received a shock;</span>
<span class="i0">But his, alas! was placed upon the sand, <span class="linenum">460</span></span>
<span class="i0">Where long it stood not, and where none can stand.</span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Than old George Fletcher on the British coast</span>
<span class="i2">Dwelt not a seaman who had more to boast:</span>
<span class="i0">Kind, simple, and sincere&mdash;he seldom spoke,</span>
<span class="i0">But sometimes sang and chorus’d “<i>Hearts of Oak</i>;”</span>
<span class="i0">In dangers steady, with his lot content,</span>
<span class="i0">His days in labour and in love were spent.</span>
<span class="i2">He left a son so like him, that the old</span>
<span class="i0">With joy exclaim’d, “’Tis Fletcher we behold;”</span>
<span class="i0">But to his brother when the kinsmen came,</span>
<span class="i0">And view’d his form, they grudged the father’s name. <span class="linenum">10</span></span>
<span class="i2">George was a bold, intrepid, careless lad,</span>
<span class="i0">With just the failings that his father had;</span>
<span class="i0">Isaac was weak, attentive, slow, exact,</span>
<span class="i0">With just the virtues that his father lack’d.</span>
<span class="i2">George lived at sea: upon the land a guest&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">He sought for recreation, not for rest&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">While, far unlike, his brother’s feebler form</span>
<span class="i0">Shrank from the cold, and shudder’d at the storm;</span>
<span class="i0">Still with the seaman’s to connect his trade,</span>
<span class="i0">The boy was bound where blocks and ropes were made. <span class="linenum">20</span></span>
<span class="i2">George, strong and sturdy, had a tender mind,</span>
<span class="i0">And was to Isaac pitiful and kind;</span>
<span class="i0">A very father, till his art was gain’d,</span>
<span class="i0">And then a friend unwearied he remain’d.</span>
<span class="i0">He saw his brother was of spirit low,</span>
<span class="i0">His temper peevish, and his motions slow;</span>
<span class="i0">Not fit to bustle in a world, or make</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Friends to his fortune for his merit’s sake:</span>
<span class="i0">But the kind sailor could not boast the art</span>
<span class="i0">Of looking deeply in the human heart; <span class="linenum">30</span></span>
<span class="i0">Else had he seen that this weak brother knew</span>
<span class="i0">What men to court&mdash;what objects to pursue;</span>
<span class="i0">That he to distant gain the way discern’d,</span>
<span class="i0">And none so crooked but his genius learn’d.</span>
<span class="i2">Isaac was poor, and this the brother felt;</span>
<span class="i0">He hired a house, and there the landman dwelt;</span>
<span class="i0">Wrought at his trade, and had an easy home,</span>
<span class="i0">For there would George with cash and comforts come;</span>
<span class="i0">And, when they parted, Isaac look’d around,</span>
<span class="i0">Where other friends and helpers might be found. <span class="linenum">40</span></span>
<span class="i2">He wish’d for some port-place, and one might fall,</span>
<span class="i0">He wisely thought, if he should try for all;</span>
<span class="i0">He had a vote&mdash;and, were it well applied,</span>
<span class="i0">Might have its worth&mdash;and he had views beside;</span>
<span class="i0">Old Burgess Steel was able to promote</span>
<span class="i0">An humble man who served him with a vote;</span>
<span class="i0">For Isaac felt not what some tempers feel,</span>
<span class="i0">But bow’d and bent the neck to Burgess Steel;</span>
<span class="i0">And great attention to a lady gave,</span>
<span class="i0">His ancient friend, a maiden spare and grave: <span class="linenum">50</span></span>
<span class="i0">One whom the visage long and look demure</span>
<span class="i0">Of Isaac pleased&mdash;he seem’d sedate and pure;</span>
<span class="i0">And his soft heart conceived a gentle flame</span>
<span class="i0">For her who waited on this virtuous dame:</span>
<span class="i0">Not an outrageous love, a scorching fire,</span>
<span class="i0">But friendly liking and chastised desire;</span>
<span class="i0">And thus he waited, patient in delay,</span>
<span class="i0">In present favour and in fortune’s way.</span>
<span class="i2">George then was coasting&mdash;war was yet delay’d,</span>
<span class="i0">And what he gain’d was to his brother paid; <span class="linenum">60</span></span>
<span class="i0">Nor ask’d the seaman what he saved or spent:</span>
<span class="i0">But took his grog, wrought hard, and was content;</span>
<span class="i0">Till war awaked the land, and George began</span>
<span class="i0">To think what part became a useful man:</span>
<span class="i0">“Press’d, I must go; why, then, ’tis better far</span>
<span class="i0">At once to enter like a British tar,</span>
<span class="i0">Than a brave captain and the foe to shun,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
<span class="i0">As if I fear’d the music of a gun.”</span>
<span class="i0">“Go not!” said Isaac&mdash;“You shall wear disguise.”</span>
<span class="i0">“What!” said the seaman, “clothe myself with lies?”&mdash; <span class="linenum">70</span></span>
<span class="i0">“Oh! but there’s danger.”&mdash;“Danger in the fleet?</span>
<span class="i0">You cannot mean, good brother, of defeat;</span>
<span class="i0">And other dangers I at land must share&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">So now adieu! and trust a brother’s care.”</span>
<span class="i2">Isaac awhile demurr’d&mdash;but, in his heart,</span>
<span class="i0">So might he share, he was disposed to part:</span>
<span class="i0">The better mind will sometimes feel the pain <span class="ws12">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Of benefactions&mdash;favour is a chain;<span class="ws20">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">But they the feeling scorn, and what they wish, disdain;&mdash;&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">While beings form’d in coarser mould will hate <span class="linenum">80</span></span>
<span class="i0">The helping hand they ought to venerate.</span>
<span class="i0">No wonder George should in this cause prevail,</span>
<span class="i0">With one contending who was glad to fail:</span>
<span class="i0">“Isaac, farewell! do wipe that doleful eye; <span class="ws5">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Crying we came, and groaning we may die.<span class="ws4">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Let us do something ’twixt the groan and cry:&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">And hear me, brother, whether pay or prize,</span>
<span class="i0">One half to thee I give and I devise;</span>
<span class="i0">For thou hast oft occasion for the aid</span>
<span class="i0">Of learn’d physicians, and they will be paid: <span class="linenum">90</span></span>
<span class="i0">Their wives and children men support, at sea,</span>
<span class="i0">And thou, my lad, art wife and child to me:</span>
<span class="i0">Farewell!&mdash;I go where hope and honour call,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor does it follow that who fights must fall.”</span>
<span class="i2">Isaac here made a poor attempt to speak,</span>
<span class="i0">And a huge tear moved slowly down his cheek;</span>
<span class="i0">Like Pluto’s iron drop, hard sign of grace,<span class="ws8">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">It slowly roll’d upon the rueful face, <span class="ws12">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Forced by the striving will alone its way to trace. &emsp;}</span>
<span class="i2">Years fled&mdash;war lasted&mdash;George at sea remain’d, <span class="linenum">100</span></span>
<span class="i0">While the slow landman still his profits gain’d.</span>
<span class="i0">A humble place was vacant&mdash;he besought</span>
<span class="i0">His patron’s interest, and the office caught;</span>
<span class="i0">For still the virgin was his faithful friend,</span>
<span class="i0">And one so sober could with truth commend,</span>
<span class="i0">Who of his own defects most humbly thought,</span>
<span class="i0">And their advice with zeal and reverence sought.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Whom thus the mistress praised, the maid approved,</span>
<span class="i0">And her he wedded whom he wisely loved.</span>
<span class="i2">No more he needs assistance&mdash;but, alas! <span class="linenum">110</span></span>
<span class="i0">He fears the money will for liquor pass;</span>
<span class="i0">Or that the seaman might to flatterers lend,</span>
<span class="i0">Or give support to some pretended friend.</span>
<span class="i0">Still, he must write&mdash;he wrote, and he confess’d</span>
<span class="i0">That, till absolved, he should be sore distress’d;</span>
<span class="i0">But one so friendly would, he thought, forgive</span>
<span class="i0">The hasty deed&mdash;Heav’n knew how he should live;</span>
<span class="i0">“But you,” he added, “as a man of sense,</span>
<span class="i0">Have well consider’d danger and expense:</span>
<span class="i0">I ran, alas! into the fatal snare, <span class="linenum">120</span></span>
<span class="i0">And now for trouble must my mind prepare;</span>
<span class="i0">And how, with children, I shall pick my way,</span>
<span class="i0">Through a hard world, is more than I can say:</span>
<span class="i0">Then change not, brother, your more happy state,</span>
<span class="i0">Or on the hazard long deliberate.”</span>
<span class="i2">George answer’d gravely, “It is right and fit,</span>
<span class="i0">In all our crosses, humbly to submit:</span>
<span class="i0">Your apprehensions are unwise, unjust;</span>
<span class="i0">Forbear repining, and expel distrust.”&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">He added, “Marriage was the joy of life,” <span class="linenum">130</span></span>
<span class="i0">And gave his service to his brother’s wife;</span>
<span class="i0">Then vow’d to bear in all expense a part,</span>
<span class="i0">And thus concluded, “Have a cheerful heart.”</span>
<span class="i2">Had the glad Isaac been his brother’s guide,</span>
<span class="i0">In these same terms the seaman had replied;</span>
<span class="i0">At such reproofs the crafty landman smiled,</span>
<span class="i0">And softly said&mdash;“This creature is a child.”</span>
<span class="i2">Twice had the gallant ship a capture made&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">And when in port the happy crew were paid,</span>
<span class="i0">Home went the sailor, with his pocket stored, <span class="linenum">140</span></span>
<span class="i0">Ease to enjoy, and pleasure to afford.</span>
<span class="i0">His time was short; joy shone in every face;</span>
<span class="i0">Isaac half fainted in the fond embrace;</span>
<span class="i0">The wife resolved her honour’d guest to please,</span>
<span class="i0">The children clung upon their uncle’s knees;</span>
<span class="i0">The grog went round, the neighbours drank his health,</span>
<span class="i0">And George exclaim’d&mdash;“Ah! what to this is wealth?</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Better,” said he, “to bear a loving heart,</span>
<span class="i0">Than roll in riches&mdash;&mdash;but we now must part!”</span>
<span class="i2">All yet is still&mdash;but hark! the winds o’ersweep <span class="linenum">150</span></span>
<span class="i0">The rising waves, and howl upon the deep;</span>
<span class="i0">Ships, late becalm’d, on mountain-billows ride&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">So life is threaten’d, and so man is tried.</span>
<span class="i2">Ill were the tidings that arrived from sea:</span>
<span class="i0">The worthy George must now a cripple be;</span>
<span class="i0">His leg was lopp’d; and, though his heart was sound,</span>
<span class="i0">Though his brave captain was with glory crown’d&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Yet much it vex’d him to repose on shore,</span>
<span class="i0">An idle log, and be of use no more.</span>
<span class="i0">True, he was sure that Isaac would receive <span class="linenum">160</span></span>
<span class="i0">All of his brother that the foe might leave;</span>
<span class="i0">To whom the seaman his design had sent,</span>
<span class="i0">Ere from the port the wounded hero went;</span>
<span class="i0">His wealth and expectations told, he “knew</span>
<span class="i0">Wherein they fail’d, what Isaac’s love would do;</span>
<span class="i0">That he the grog and cabin would supply,</span>
<span class="i0">Where George at anchor during life would lie.”</span>
<span class="i2">The landman read&mdash;and, reading, grew distress’d:&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“Could he resolve t’ admit so poor a guest?</span>
<span class="i0">Better at Greenwich might the sailor stay, <span class="linenum">170</span></span>
<span class="i0">Unless his purse could for his comforts pay;”</span>
<span class="i0">So Isaac judged, and to his wife appeal’d,</span>
<span class="i0">But yet acknowledged it was best to yield:</span>
<span class="i0">“Perhaps his pension, with what sums remain</span>
<span class="i0">Due or unsquander’d, may the man maintain;</span>
<span class="i0">Refuse we must not.”&mdash;With a heavy sigh</span>
<span class="i0">The lady heard, and made her kind reply:</span>
<span class="i0">“Nor would I wish it, Isaac, were we sure</span>
<span class="i0">How long his crazy building will endure;</span>
<span class="i0">Like an old house, that every day appears <span class="linenum">180</span></span>
<span class="i0">About to fall&mdash;he may be propp’d for years;</span>
<span class="i0">For a few months, indeed, we might comply,</span>
<span class="i0">But these old batter’d fellows never die.”</span>
<span class="i2">The hand of Isaac George on entering took,</span>
<span class="i0">With love and resignation in his look;</span>
<span class="i0">Declared his comfort in the fortune past,</span>
<span class="i0">And joy to find his anchor safely cast;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
<span class="i0">“Call then my nephews, let the grog be brought,</span>
<span class="i0">And I will tell them how the ship was fought.”</span>
<span class="i2">Alas! our simple seaman should have known,<span class="ws9">}</span><span class="linenum">190</span></span>
<span class="i0">That all the care, the kindness, he had shown,<span class="ws11">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Were from his brother’s heart, if not his memory, flown:&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">All swept away to be perceived no more,</span>
<span class="i0">Like idle structures on the sandy shore;</span>
<span class="i0">The chance amusement of the playful boy,</span>
<span class="i0">That the rude billows in their rage destroy.</span>
<span class="i2">Poor George confess’d, though loth the truth to find,</span>
<span class="i0">Slight was his knowledge of a brother’s mind:</span>
<span class="i0">The vulgar pipe was to the wife offence,</span>
<span class="i0">The frequent grog to Isaac an expense; <span class="linenum">200</span></span>
<span class="i0">“Would friends like hers,” she question’d, “choose to come,</span>
<span class="i0">Where clouds of poison’d fume defiled a room?</span>
<span class="i0">This could their lady-friend, and Burgess Steel,</span>
<span class="i0">(Teased with his worship’s asthma) bear to feel?</span>
<span class="i0">Could they associate or converse with him&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">A loud rough sailor with a timber limb?”</span>
<span class="i2">Cold as he grew, still Isaac strove to show,</span>
<span class="i0">By well-feign’d care, that cold he could not grow;</span>
<span class="i0">And when he saw his brother look distress’d,</span>
<span class="i0">He strove some petty comforts to suggest; <span class="linenum">210</span></span>
<span class="i0">On his wife solely their neglect to lay,</span>
<span class="i0">And then t’ excuse it as a woman’s way;</span>
<span class="i0">He too was chidden when her rules he broke,</span>
<span class="i0">And then she sicken’d at the scent of smoke.</span>
<span class="i2">George, though in doubt, was still consoled to find</span>
<span class="i0">His brother wishing to be reckon’d kind.</span>
<span class="i0">That Isaac seem’d concern’d by his distress,</span>
<span class="i0">Gave to his injured feelings some redress;</span>
<span class="i0">But none he found disposed to lend an ear</span>
<span class="i0">To stories all were once intent to hear; <span class="linenum">220</span></span>
<span class="i0">Except his nephew, seated on his knee,</span>
<span class="i0">He found no creature cared about the sea;</span>
<span class="i0">But George indeed&mdash;for George they call’d the boy,</span>
<span class="i0">When his good uncle was their boast and joy&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Would listen long, and would contend with sleep,</span>
<span class="i0">To hear the woes and wonders of the deep;</span>
<span class="i0">Till the fond mother cried&mdash;“That man will teach</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The foolish boy his loud and boisterous speech.”</span>
<span class="i0">So judged the father&mdash;and the boy was taught</span>
<span class="i0">To shun the uncle, whom his love had sought. <span class="linenum">230</span></span>
<span class="i2">The mask of kindness now but seldom worn,</span>
<span class="i0">George felt each evil harder to be borne;</span>
<span class="i0">And cried (vexation growing day by day),</span>
<span class="i0">“Ah! brother Isaac!&mdash;What! I’m in the way!”&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“No! on my credit, look ye, No! but I<span class="ws10">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Am fond of peace, and my repose would buy<span class="ws4">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">On any terms&mdash;in short, we must comply: <span class="ws6">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">My spouse had money&mdash;she must have her will&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Ah! brother&mdash;marriage is a bitter pill.”&mdash;</span>
<span class="i2">George tried the lady&mdash;“Sister, I offend”&mdash; <span class="linenum">240</span></span>
<span class="i0">“Me?” she replied; “Oh no!&mdash;you may depend</span>
<span class="i0">On my regard&mdash;but watch your brother’s way,</span>
<span class="i0">Whom I, like you, must study and obey.”</span>
<span class="i2">“Ah!” thought the seaman, “what a head was mine,</span>
<span class="i0">That easy birth at Greenwich to resign!</span>
<span class="i0">I’ll to the parish”&mdash;but a little pride,</span>
<span class="i0">And some affection, put the thought aside.</span>
<span class="i2">Now gross neglect and open scorn he bore</span>
<span class="i0">In silent sorrow&mdash;but he felt the more;</span>
<span class="i0">The odious pipe he to the kitchen took, <span class="linenum">250</span></span>
<span class="i0">Or strove to profit by some pious book.</span>
<span class="i2">When the mind stoops to this degraded state,</span>
<span class="i0">New griefs will darken the dependent’s fate;</span>
<span class="i0">“Brother!” said Isaac, “you will sure excuse</span>
<span class="i0">The little freedom I’m compell’d to use:</span>
<span class="i0">My wife’s relations&mdash;(curse the haughty crew)&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Affect such niceness, and such dread of you:</span>
<span class="i0">You speak so loud&mdash;and they have natures soft&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Brother&mdash;&mdash;I wish&mdash;&mdash;do go upon the loft!”</span>
<span class="i2">Poor George obey’d, and to the garret fled, <span class="linenum">260</span></span>
<span class="i0">Where not a being saw the tears he shed.</span>
<span class="i0">But more was yet required, for guests were come,</span>
<span class="i0">Who could not dine if he disgraced the room.</span>
<span class="i0">It shock’d his spirit to be esteem’d unfit</span>
<span class="i0">With an own brother and his wife to sit;</span>
<span class="i0">He grew rebellious&mdash;at the vestry spoke</span>
<span class="i0">For weekly aid&mdash;&mdash;they heard it as a joke:</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
<span class="i0">So kind a brother, and so wealthy&mdash;&mdash;you</span>
<span class="i0">Apply to us?&mdash;&mdash;No! this will never do:</span>
<span class="i0">Good neighbour Fletcher,” said the overseer, <span class="linenum">270</span></span>
<span class="i0">“We are engaged&mdash;you can have nothing here!”</span>
<span class="i2">George mutter’d something in despairing tone,</span>
<span class="i0">Then sought his loft, to think and grieve alone;</span>
<span class="i0">Neglected, slighted, restless on his bed,</span>
<span class="i0">With heart half broken, and with scraps ill fed;</span>
<span class="i0">Yet was he pleased that hours for play design’d</span>
<span class="i0">Were given to ease his ever-troubled mind;</span>
<span class="i0">The child still listen’d with increasing joy,</span>
<span class="i0">And he was soothed by the attentive boy.</span>
<span class="i2">At length he sicken’d, and this duteous child <span class="linenum">280</span></span>
<span class="i0">Watch’d o’er his sickness, and his pains beguiled;</span>
<span class="i0">The mother bade him from the loft refrain,</span>
<span class="i0">But, though with caution, yet he went again;</span>
<span class="i0">And now his tales the sailor feebly told,</span>
<span class="i0">His heart was heavy, and his limbs were cold:</span>
<span class="i0">The tender boy came often to entreat</span>
<span class="i0">His good kind friend would of his presents eat,</span>
<span class="i0">Purloin’d or purchased; for he saw, with shame,</span>
<span class="i0">The food untouch’d that to his uncle came:</span>
<span class="i0">Who, sick in body and in mind, received <span class="linenum">290</span></span>
<span class="i0">The boy’s indulgence, gratified and grieved.</span>
<span class="i2">“Uncle will die!” said George&mdash;the piteous wife</span>
<span class="i0">Exclaim’d, “she saw no value in his life;</span>
<span class="i0">But sick or well, to my commands attend,</span>
<span class="i0">And go no more to your complaining friend.”</span>
<span class="i0">The boy was vex’d, he felt his heart reprove</span>
<span class="i0">The stern decree.&mdash;What! punish’d for his love!</span>
<span class="i0">No! he would go, but softly, to the room</span>
<span class="i0">Stealing in silence&mdash;for he knew his doom.</span>
<span class="i2">Once in a week the father came to say, <span class="linenum">300</span></span>
<span class="i0">“George, are you ill?”&mdash;and hurried him away;</span>
<span class="i0">Yet to his wife would on their duties dwell,</span>
<span class="i0">And often cry, “Do use my brother well;”</span>
<span class="i0">And something kind, no question, Isaac meant,</span>
<span class="i0">Who took vast credit for the vague intent.</span>
<span class="i2">But, truly kind, the gentle boy essay’d</span>
<span class="i0">To cheer his uncle, firm, although afraid;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But now the father caught him at the door,</span>
<span class="i0">And, swearing&mdash;yes, the man in office swore,</span>
<span class="i0">And cried, “Away! How! Brother, I’m surprised, <span class="linenum">310</span></span>
<span class="i0">That one so old can be so ill advised.</span>
<span class="i0">Let him not dare to visit you again,</span>
<span class="i0">Your cursed stories will disturb his brain;</span>
<span class="i0">Is it not vile to court a foolish boy,</span>
<span class="i0">Your own absurd narrations to enjoy?</span>
<span class="i0">What! sullen!&mdash;ha! George Fletcher? you shall see,</span>
<span class="i0">Proud as you are, your bread depends on me!”</span>
<span class="i2">He spoke, and, frowning, to his dinner went,</span>
<span class="i0">Then cool’d and felt some qualms of discontent;</span>
<span class="i0">And thought on times when he compell’d his son <span class="linenum">320</span></span>
<span class="i0">To hear these stories, nay, to beg for one;</span>
<span class="i0">But the wife’s wrath o’ercame the brother’s pain,</span>
<span class="i0">And shame was felt, and conscience rose in vain.</span>
<span class="i2">George yet stole up&mdash;he saw his uncle lie</span>
<span class="i0">Sick on the bed, and heard his heavy sigh:</span>
<span class="i0">So he resolved, before he went to rest,</span>
<span class="i0">To comfort one so dear and so distress’d;</span>
<span class="i0">Then watch’d his time, but, with a child-like art,</span>
<span class="i0">Betray’d a something treasured at his heart.</span>
<span class="i0">Th’ observant wife remark’d, “the boy is grown <span class="linenum">330</span></span>
<span class="i0">So like your brother, that he seems his own;</span>
<span class="i0">So close and sullen! and I still suspect</span>
<span class="i0">They often meet&mdash;do watch them and detect.”</span>
<span class="i2">George now remark’d that all was still as night,</span>
<span class="i0">And hasten’d up with terror and delight;</span>
<span class="i0">“Uncle!” he cried, and softly tapp’d the door;</span>
<span class="i0">“Do let me in”&mdash;but he could add no more;</span>
<span class="i0">The careful father caught him in the fact,</span>
<span class="i0">And cried, “You serpent! is it thus you act?</span>
<span class="i0">Back to your mother!” and, with hasty blow, <span class="linenum">340</span></span>
<span class="i0">He sent th’ indignant boy to grieve below;</span>
<span class="i0">Then at the door an angry speech began:</span>
<span class="i0">“Is this your conduct&mdash;is it thus you plan?</span>
<span class="i0">Seduce my child, and make my house a scene</span>
<span class="i0">Of vile dispute&mdash;What is it that you mean?&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">George, are you dumb? do learn to know your friends,</span>
<span class="i0">And think awhile on whom your bread depends.&mdash;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
<span class="i0">What! not a word? be thankful I am cool;</span>
<span class="i0">But, sir, beware, nor longer play the fool.&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Come! brother, come! what is that you seek <span class="linenum">350</span></span>
<span class="i0">By this rebellion?&mdash;Speak, you villain, speak!&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Weeping! I warrant, sorrow makes you dumb;</span>
<span class="i0">I’ll ope your mouth, impostor! if I come.</span>
<span class="i0">Let me approach&mdash;I’ll shake you from the bed,</span>
<span class="i0">You stubborn dog&mdash;&mdash;Oh God! my brother’s dead!&mdash;”</span>
<span class="i2">Timid was Isaac, and in all the past</span>
<span class="i0">He felt a purpose to be kind at last;</span>
<span class="i0">Nor did he mean his brother to depart,</span>
<span class="i0">Till he had shown this kindness of his heart:</span>
<span class="i0">But day by day he put the cause aside, <span class="linenum">360</span></span>
<span class="i0">Induced by av’rice, peevishness, or pride.</span>
<span class="i2">But, now awaken’d, from this fatal time</span>
<span class="i0">His conscience Isaac felt, and found his crime:</span>
<span class="i0">He raised to George a monumental stone,</span>
<span class="i0">And there retired to sigh and think alone;</span>
<span class="i0">An ague seized him, he grew pale, and shook&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“So,” said his son, “would my poor uncle look.”&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“And so, my child, shall I like him expire.”&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“No! you have physic and a cheerful fire.”&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“Unhappy sinner! yes, I’m well supplied <span class="linenum">370</span></span>
<span class="i0">With every comfort my cold heart denied.”</span>
<span class="i0">He view’d his brother now, but not as one</span>
<span class="i0">Who vex’d his wife by fondness for her son;</span>
<span class="i0">Not as with wooden limb, and seaman’s tale,</span>
<span class="i0">The odious pipe, vile grog, or humbler ale:</span>
<span class="i0">He now the worth and grief alone can view</span>
<span class="i0">Of one so mild, so generous, and so true:</span>
<span class="i0">The frank, kind brother, with such open heart,</span>
<span class="i0">And I to break it&mdash;’twas a dæmon’s part!”</span>
<span class="i2">So Isaac now, as led by conscience, feels, <span class="linenum">380</span></span>
<span class="i0">Nor his unkindness palliates or conceals.</span>
<span class="i0">“This is your folly,” said his heartless wife;</span>
<span class="i0">“Alas! my folly cost my brother’s life:</span>
<span class="i0">It suffer’d him to languish and decay,<span class="ws12">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">My gentle brother, whom I could not pay, <span class="ws8">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And therefore left to pine, and fret his life away.” &emsp;}</span>
<span class="i2">He takes his son, and bids the boy unfold</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
<span class="i0">All the good uncle of his feelings told,</span>
<span class="i0">All he lamented&mdash;and the ready tear</span>
<span class="i0">Falls as he listens, soothed and grieved to hear. <span class="linenum">390</span></span>
<span class="i2">“Did he not curse me, child?”&mdash;“He never cursed,</span>
<span class="i0">But could not breathe, and said his heart would burst”&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“And so will mine.”&mdash;“Then, father, you must pray;</span>
<span class="i0">My uncle said it took his pains away.”</span>
<span class="i2">Repeating thus his sorrows, Isaac shows <span class="ws9">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">That he, repenting, feels the debt he owes,<span class="ws10">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And from this source alone his every comfort flows.&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">He takes no joy in office, honours, gain;</span>
<span class="i0">They make him humble, nay, they give him pain;</span>
<span class="i0">“These from my heart,” he cries, “all feeling drove; <span class="linenum">400</span></span>
<span class="i0">They made me cold to nature, dead to love.”</span>
<span class="i0">He takes no joy in home, but, sighing, sees</span>
<span class="i0">A son in sorrow, and a wife at ease;</span>
<span class="i0">He takes no joy in office&mdash;see him now,</span>
<span class="i0">And Burgess Steel has but a passing bow;</span>
<span class="i0">Of one sad train of gloomy thoughts possess’d, <span class="ws4">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">He takes no joy in friends, in food, in rest&mdash;<span class="ws7">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Dark are the evil days, and void of peace the best. &emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">And thus he lives, if living be to sigh,<span class="ws9">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And from all comforts of the world to fly, <span class="ws5">}</span><span class="linenum">410</span></span>
<span class="i0">Without a hope in life&mdash;without a wish to die.&emsp;}</span>

<p class="f110"><i>THE LEARNED BOY.</i></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">An honest man was Farmer Jones, and true;</span>
<span class="i0">He did by all as all by him should do;</span>
<span class="i0">Grave, cautious, careful, fond of gain was he,</span>
<span class="i0">Yet famed for rustic hospitality.</span>
<span class="i0">Left with his children in a widow’d state,</span>
<span class="i0">The quiet man submitted to his fate;</span>
<span class="i0">Though prudent matrons waited for his call,</span>
<span class="i0">With cool forbearance he avoided all;</span>
<span class="i0">Though each profess’d a pure maternal joy,</span>
<span class="i0">By kind attention to his feeble boy. <span class="linenum">10</span></span>
<span class="i0">And&mdash;though a friendly widow knew no rest,</span>
<span class="i0">Whilst neighbour Jones was lonely and distress’d,</span>
<span class="i0">Nay, though the maidens spoke in tender tone</span>
<span class="i0">Their hearts’ concern to see him left alone&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Jones still persisted in that cheerless life,</span>
<span class="i0">As if t’were sin to take a second wife.</span>
<span class="i2">Oh! ’tis a precious thing, when wives are dead,</span>
<span class="i0">To find such numbers who will serve instead;</span>
<span class="i0">And, in whatever state a man be thrown,</span>
<span class="i0">’Tis that precisely they would wish their own. <span class="linenum">20</span></span>
<span class="i0">Left the departed infants&mdash;then their joy</span>
<span class="i0">Is to sustain each lovely girl and boy;</span>
<span class="i0">Whatever calling his, whatever trade,</span>
<span class="i0">To that their chief attention has been paid;</span>
<span class="i0">His happy taste in all things they approve,</span>
<span class="i0">His friends they honour, and his food they love;</span>
<span class="i0">His wish for order, prudence in affairs,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And equal temper, (thank their stars!) are theirs;</span>
<span class="i0">In fact, it seem’d to be a thing decreed,</span>
<span class="i0">And fix’d as fate, that marriage must succeed. <span class="linenum">30</span></span>
<span class="i0">Yet some, like Jones, with stubborn hearts and hard,</span>
<span class="i0">Can hear such claims, and show them no regard.</span>
<span class="i2">Soon as our farmer, like a general, found</span>
<span class="i0">By what strong foes he was encompass’d round&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Engage he dared not, and he could not fly,</span>
<span class="i0">But saw his hope in gentle parley lie;</span>
<span class="i0">With looks of kindness then, and trembling heart,</span>
<span class="i0">He met the foe, and art opposed to art.</span>
<span class="i2">Now spoke that foe insidious&mdash;gentle tones,</span>
<span class="i0">And gentle looks, assumed for Farmer Jones: <span class="linenum">40</span></span>
<span class="i0">“Three girls,” the widow cried, “a lively three</span>
<span class="i0">To govern well&mdash;indeed it cannot be.”</span>
<span class="i0">“Yes,” he replied, “it calls for pains and care;</span>
<span class="i0">But I must bear it.”&mdash;“Sir, you cannot bear;</span>
<span class="i0">Your son is weak, and asks a mother’s eye.”&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“That, my kind friend, a father’s may supply.”&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“Such growing griefs your very soul will tease.”&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“To grieve another would not give me ease;</span>
<span class="i0">I have a mother.”&mdash;“She, poor ancient soul!</span>
<span class="i0">Can she the spirits of the young control? <span class="linenum">50</span></span>
<span class="i0">Can she thy peace promote, partake thy care,</span>
<span class="i0">Procure thy comforts, and thy sorrows share?</span>
<span class="i0">Age is itself impatient, uncontroll’d.”&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“But wives like mothers must at length be old.”&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“Thou hast shrewd servants&mdash;they are evils sore.”&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“Yet a shrewd mistress might afflict me more.”&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“Wilt thou not be a weary wailing man?”&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“Alas! and I must bear it as I can.”</span>
<span class="i2">Resisted thus, the widow soon withdrew,</span>
<span class="i0">That in his pride the hero might pursue; <span class="linenum">60</span></span>
<span class="i0">And off his wonted guard, in some retreat,</span>
<span class="i0">Find from a foe prepared entire defeat.</span>
<span class="i0">But he was prudent, for he knew in flight</span>
<span class="i0">These Parthian warriors turn again and fight;</span>
<span class="i0">He but at freedom, not at glory aim’d,</span>
<span class="i0">And only safety by his caution claim’d.</span>
<span class="i2">Thus, when a great and powerful state decrees</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Upon a small one, in its love, to seize&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">It vows in kindness to protect, defend,</span>
<span class="i0">And be the fond ally, the faithful friend; <span class="linenum">70</span></span>
<span class="i0">It therefore wills that humbler state to place</span>
<span class="i0">Its hopes of safety in a fond embrace:</span>
<span class="i0">Then must that humbler state its wisdom prove,</span>
<span class="i0">By kind rejection of such pressing love;</span>
<span class="i0">Must dread such dangerous friendship to commence,</span>
<span class="i0">And stand collected in its own defence.&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Our farmer thus the proffer’d kindness fled,</span>
<span class="i0">And shunn’d the love that into bondage led.</span>
<span class="i2">The widow failing, fresh besiegers came,</span>

<span class="i0">And each foresaw a thousand ills attend</span>
<span class="i0">The man that fled from so discreet a friend;</span>
<span class="i0">And pray’d, kind soul! that no event might make</span>
<span class="i0">The harden’d heart of Farmer Jones to ache.</span>
<span class="i2">But he still govern’d with resistless hand,</span>
<span class="i0">And where he could not guide he would command.</span>
<span class="i0">With steady view in course direct he steer’d,</span>
<span class="i0">And his fair daughters loved him, though they fear’d;</span>
<span class="i0">Each had her school, and, as his wealth was known,</span>
<span class="i0">Each had in time a household of her own. <span class="linenum">90</span></span>
<span class="i2">The boy indeed was, at the grandam’s side,</span>
<span class="i0">Humour’d and train’d, her trouble and her pride:</span>
<span class="i0">Companions dear, with speech and spirits mild,</span>
<span class="i0">The childish widow and the vapourish child.</span>
<span class="i0">This nature prompts; minds uninform’d and weak</span>
<span class="i0">In such alliance ease and comfort seek;</span>

<span class="i0">The child is pleased to meet regard from age, <span class="linenum">100</span></span>
<span class="i0">The old are pleased ev’n children to engage;</span>
<span class="i0">And all their wisdom, scorn’d by proud mankind,</span>
<span class="i0">They love to pour into the ductile mind,</span>
<span class="i0">By its own weakness into error led,</span>
<span class="i0">And by fond age with prejudices fed.</span>
<span class="i2">The father, thankful for the good he had,</span>
<span class="i0">Yet saw with pain a whining, timid lad;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Whom he, instructing, led through cultured fields,</span>
<span class="i0">To show what man performs, what nature yields;</span>
<span class="i0">But Stephen, listless, wander’d from the view;<span class="ws6">}</span><span class="linenum">110</span></span>
<span class="i0">From beasts he fled, for butterflies he flew, <span class="ws8">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And idly gazed about, in search of something new. &emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">The lambs indeed he loved, and wish’d to play</span>
<span class="i0">With things so mild, so harmless, and so gay;</span>
<span class="i0">Best pleased the weakest of the flock to see,</span>
<span class="i0">With whom he felt a sickly sympathy.</span>
<span class="i2">Meantime, the dame was anxious, day and night,<span class="ws7">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">To guide the notions of her babe aright, <span class="ws16">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And on the favourite mind to throw her glimmering light;&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">Her Bible-stories she impress’d betimes, <span class="linenum">120</span></span>
<span class="i0">And fill’d his head with hymns and holy rhymes;</span>
<span class="i0">On powers unseen, the good and ill, she dwelt,</span>
<span class="i0">And the poor boy mysterious terrors felt;</span>
<span class="i0">From frightful dreams, he, waking, sobb’d in dread,</span>
<span class="i0">Till the good lady came to guard his bed.</span>
<span class="i2">The father wish’d such errors to correct,</span>
<span class="i0">But let them pass in duty and respect.</span>
<span class="i0">But more it grieved his worthy mind to see</span>
<span class="i0">That Stephen never would a farmer be;</span>
<span class="i0">In vain he tried the shiftless lad to guide, <span class="linenum">130</span></span>
<span class="i0">And yet ’twas time that something should be tried.</span>
<span class="i0">He at the village-school perchance might gain</span>
<span class="i0">All that such mind could gather and retain;</span>
<span class="i0">Yet the good dame affirm’d her favourite child</span>
<span class="i0">Was apt and studious, though sedate and mild;</span>
<span class="i0">“That he on many a learned point could speak,</span>
<span class="i0">And that his body, not his mind, was weak.”</span>
<span class="i2">The father doubted&mdash;but to school was sent</span>
<span class="i0">The timid Stephen, weeping as he went:</span>
<span class="i0">There the rude lads compell’d the child to fight, <span class="linenum">140</span></span>
<span class="i0">And sent him bleeding to his home at night;</span>
<span class="i0">At this the grandam more indulgent grew,</span>
<span class="i0">And bade her darling “shun the beastly crew;</span>
<span class="i0">Whom Satan ruled, and who were sure to lie</span>
<span class="i0">Howling in torments, when they came to die.”</span>
<span class="i0">This was such comfort, that in high disdain</span>
<span class="i0">He told their fate, and felt their blows again.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, if the boy had not a hero’s heart,</span>
<span class="i0">Within the school he play’d a better part:</span>
<span class="i0">He wrote a clean, fine hand, and at his slate <span class="linenum">150</span></span>
<span class="i0">With more success than many a hero sate;</span>
<span class="i0">He thought not much indeed&mdash;but what depends</span>
<span class="i0">On pains and care was at his fingers’ ends.</span>
<span class="i2">This had his father’s praise, who now espied</span>
<span class="i0">A spark of merit, with a blaze of pride;</span>
<span class="i0">And, though a farmer he would never make,</span>
<span class="i0">He might a pen with some advantage take;</span>
<span class="i0">And as a clerk that instrument employ,</span>
<span class="i0">So well adapted to a timid boy.</span>
<span class="i2">A London cousin soon a place obtain’d, <span class="linenum">160</span></span>
<span class="i0">Easy but humble&mdash;little could be gain’d.</span>
<span class="i0">The time arrived when youth and age must part,</span>
<span class="i0">Tears in each eye, and sorrow in each heart;</span>
<span class="i0">The careful father bade his son attend</span>
<span class="i0">To all his duties, and obey his friend;</span>
<span class="i0">To keep his church and there behave aright, &emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">As one existing in his Maker’s sight,<span class="ws8">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Till acts to habits led, and duty to delight:<span class="ws4">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">“Then try, my boy, as quickly as you can,</span>

<span class="i0">I say, be honest, faithful, civil, true,</span>

<span class="i0">Heroic men, their country’s boast and pride,</span>

<span class="i0">(’Tis fairly stock’d) of what it will produce; <span class="linenum">180</span></span>
<span class="i0">And now my blessing, not as any charm</span>
<span class="i0">Or conjuration; but ’twill do no harm.”</span>
<span class="i2">Stephen, whose thoughts were wandering up and down,</span>
<span class="i0">Now charm’d with promised sights in London-town,</span>
<span class="i0">Now loth to leave his grandam&mdash;lost the force,</span>
<span class="i0">The drift and tenor of this grave discourse;</span>
<span class="i0">But, in a general way, he understood</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
<span class="i0">’Twas good advice, and meant, “My son, be good;”</span>
<span class="i0">And Stephen knew that all such precepts mean,</span>
<span class="i0">That lads should read their Bible, and be clean. <span class="linenum">190</span></span>
<span class="i2">The good old lady, though in some distress,</span>
<span class="i0">Begg’d her dear Stephen would his grief suppress:</span>
<span class="i0">“Nay, dry those eyes, my child&mdash;and, first of all,</span>
<span class="i0">Hold fast thy faith, whatever may befall;</span>
<span class="i0">Hear the best preacher, and preserve the text</span>
<span class="i0">For meditation, till you hear the next;</span>
<span class="i0">Within your Bible night and morning look&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">There is your duty, read no other book;</span>
<span class="i0">Be not in crowds, in broils, in riots seen,</span>
<span class="i0">And keep your conscience and your linen clean. <span class="linenum">200</span></span>
<span class="i0">Be you a Joseph, and the time may be,</span>
<span class="i0">When kings and rulers will be ruled by thee.”</span>
<span class="i2">“Nay,” said the father&mdash;&mdash;“Hush, my son,” replied</span>
<span class="i0">The dame&mdash;&mdash;“The Scriptures must not be denied.”</span>
<span class="i2">The lad, still weeping, heard the wheels approach,</span>
<span class="i0">And took his place within the evening coach,</span>
<span class="i0">With heart quite rent asunder: On one side</span>
<span class="i0">Was love, and grief, and fear, for scenes untried;</span>
<span class="i0">Wild beasts and wax-work fill’d the happier part</span>
<span class="i0">Of Stephen’s varying and divided heart; <span class="linenum">210</span></span>
<span class="i0">This he betray’d by sighs and questions strange,</span>
<span class="i0">Of famous shows, the Tower, and the Exchange.</span>
<span class="i2">Soon at his desk was placed the curious boy,</span>
<span class="i0">Demure and silent at his new employ;</span>
<span class="i0">Yet, as he could, he much attention paid</span>
<span class="i0">To all around him, cautious and afraid.</span>
<span class="i0">On older clerks his eager eyes were fix’d,</span>
<span class="i0">But Stephen never in their council mix’d;</span>
<span class="i0">Much their contempt he fear’d, for, if like them,</span>
<span class="i0">He felt assured he should himself contemn: <span class="linenum">220</span></span>
<span class="i0">“Oh! they were all so eloquent, so free,</span>
<span class="i0">No! he was nothing&mdash;nothing could he be.</span>
<span class="i0">They dress so smartly, and so boldly look,</span>
<span class="i0">And talk as if they read it from a book;</span>
<span class="i0">But I,” said Stephen, “will forbear to speak,</span>
<span class="i0">And they will think me prudent, and not weak.</span>
<span class="i0">They talk, the instant they have dropp’d the pen,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Of singing-women and of acting-men;</span>
<span class="i0">Of plays and places where at night they walk</span>
<span class="i0">Beneath the lamps, and with the ladies talk; <span class="linenum">230</span></span>
<span class="i0">While other ladies for their pleasure sing,</span>
<span class="i0">Oh! ’tis a glorious and a happy thing.</span>
<span class="i0">They would despise me, did they understand</span>
<span class="i0">I dare not look upon a scene so grand;</span>
<span class="i0">Or see the plays when critics rise and roar,</span>
<span class="i0">And hiss and groan, and cry&mdash;‘Encore! encore!’&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">There’s one among them looks a little kind;</span>
<span class="i0">If more encouraged, I would ope my mind.”</span>
<span class="i2">Alas! poor Stephen, happier had he kept</span>
<span class="i0">His purpose secret, while his envy slept; <span class="linenum">240</span></span>
<span class="i0">Virtue, perhaps, had conquer’d, or his shame</span>
<span class="i0">At least preserved him simple as he came.</span>
<span class="i0">A year elapsed before this clerk began</span>
<span class="i0">To treat the rustic something like a man;</span>
<span class="i0">He then in trifling points the youth advised,</span>
<span class="i0">Talk’d of his coat, and had it modernized;</span>
<span class="i0">Or with the lad a Sunday-walk would take,</span>
<span class="i0">And kindly strive his passions to awake;</span>
<span class="i0">Meanwhile explaining all they heard and saw,</span>
<span class="i0">Till Stephen stood in wonderment and awe. <span class="linenum">250</span></span>
<span class="i0">To a neat garden near the town they stray’d,</span>
<span class="i0">Where the lad felt delighted and afraid;</span>
<span class="i0">There all he saw was smart, and fine, and fair&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">He could but marvel how he ventured there:</span>
<span class="i0">Soon he observed, with terror and alarm,</span>
<span class="i0">His friend enlock’d within a lady’s arm,</span>
<span class="i0">And freely talking&mdash;“But it is,” said he,</span>
<span class="i0">“A near relation, and that makes him free;”</span>
<span class="i0">And much amazed was Stephen, when he knew</span>
<span class="i0">This was the first and only interview; <span class="linenum">260</span></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, had that lovely arm by him been seized,</span>
<span class="i0">The lovely owner had been highly pleased:</span>
<span class="i0">“Alas!” he sigh’d, “I never can contrive,</span>
<span class="i0">At such bold, blessed freedoms to arrive;</span>
<span class="i0">Never shall I such happy courage boast;</span>
<span class="i0">I dare as soon encounter with a ghost.”</span>
<span class="i2">Now to a play the friendly couple went,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But the boy murmur’d at the money spent;</span>
<span class="i0">“He loved,” he said, “to buy, but not to spend&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">They only talk awhile, and there’s an end.” <span class="linenum">270</span></span>
<span class="i2">“Come, you shall purchase books,” the friend replied;</span>
<span class="i0">“You are bewilder’d, and you want a guide;</span>
<span class="i0">To me refer the choice, and you shall find</span>
<span class="i0">The light break in upon your stagnant mind!”</span>
<span class="i2">The cooler clerks exclaim’d, “In vain your art</span>
<span class="i0">T’ improve a cub without a head or heart;</span>
<span class="i0">Rustics, though coarse, and savages, though wild,</span>
<span class="i0">Our cares may render liberal and mild;</span>
<span class="i0">But what, my friend, can flow from all these pains?</span>
<span class="i0">There is no dealing with a lack of brains.”&mdash; <span class="linenum">280</span></span>
<span class="i2">“True I am hopeless to behold him man;</span>
<span class="i0">But let me make the booby what I can:</span>
<span class="i0">Though the rude stone no polish will display,</span>
<span class="i0">Yet you may strip the rugged coat away.”</span>
<span class="i2">Stephen beheld his books&mdash;“I love to know</span>
<span class="i0">How money goes&mdash;now here is that to show;</span>
<span class="i0">And now,” he cried, “I shall be pleased to get</span>
<span class="i0">Beyond the Bible&mdash;there I puzzle yet.”</span>
<span class="i2">He spoke abash’d&mdash;“Nay, nay!” the friend replied,</span>
<span class="i0">“You need not lay the good old book aside; <span class="linenum">290</span></span>
<span class="i0">Antique and curious, I myself indeed</span>
<span class="i0">Read it at times, but as a man should read;</span>
<span class="i0">A fine old work it is, and I protest</span>
<span class="i0">I hate to hear it treated as a jest;</span>
<span class="i0">The book has wisdom in it, if you look</span>
<span class="i0">Wisely upon it, as another book;</span>
<span class="i0">For superstition (as our priests of sin</span>
<span class="i0">Are pleased to tell us) makes us blind within.&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Of this hereafter&mdash;we will now select</span>
<span class="i0">Some works to please you, others to direct; <span class="linenum">300</span></span>
<span class="i0">Tales and romances shall your fancy feed,</span>
<span class="i0">And reasoners form your morals and your creed.”</span>
<span class="i2">The books were view’d, the price was fairly paid,</span>
<span class="i0">And Stephen read, undaunted, undismay’d&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">But not till first he paper’d all the row,</span>
<span class="i0">And placed in order, to enjoy the show;</span>
<span class="i0">Next letter’d all the backs with care and speed,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Set them in ranks, and then began to read.</span>
<span class="i2">The love of order,&mdash;I the thing receive</span>
<span class="i0">From reverend men, and I in part believe&mdash; <span class="linenum">310</span></span>
<span class="i0">Shows a clear mind and clean, and whoso needs</span>
<span class="i0">This love but seldom in the world succeeds;</span>
<span class="i0">And yet with this some other love must be,</span>
<span class="i0">Ere I can fully to the fact agree.</span>
<span class="i0">Valour and study may by order gain,</span>
<span class="i0">By order sovereigns hold more steady reign;</span>
<span class="i0">Through all the tribes of nature order runs,</span>
<span class="i0">And rules around in systems and in suns;</span>
<span class="i0">Still has the love of order found a place <span class="ws13">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">With all that’s low, degrading, mean, and base, <span class="ws7">}</span><span class="linenum">320</span></span>
<span class="i0">With all that merits scorn, and all that meets disgrace:&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">In the cold miser, of all change afraid;</span>
<span class="i0">In pompous men, in public seats obey’d;</span>
<span class="i0">In humble placemen, heralds, solemn drones,</span>
<span class="i0">Fanciers of flowers, and lads like Stephen Jones;</span>
<span class="i0">Order to these is armour and defence,</span>
<span class="i0">And love of method serves in lack of sense.</span>
<span class="i2">For rustic youth could I a list produce</span>
<span class="i0">Of Stephen’s books, how great might be the use;</span>
<span class="i0">But evil fate was theirs&mdash;survey’d, enjoy’d <span class="linenum">330</span></span>
<span class="i0">Some happy months, and then by force destroy’d.</span>
<span class="i0">So will’d the fates&mdash;but these, with patience read,</span>
<span class="i0">Had vast effect on Stephen’s heart and head.</span>
<span class="i2">This soon appear’d&mdash;within a single week</span>
<span class="i0">He oped his lips, and made attempt to speak;</span>
<span class="i0">He fail’d indeed&mdash;but still his friend confess’d</span>
<span class="i0">The best have fail’d, and he had done his best.</span>
<span class="i0">The first of swimmers, when at first he swims,</span>
<span class="i0">Has little use or freedom in his limbs;</span>
<span class="i0">Nay, when at length he strikes with manly force, <span class="linenum">340</span></span>
<span class="i0">The cramp may seize him, and impede his course.</span>
<span class="i2">Encouraged thus, our clerk again essay’d</span>
<span class="i0">The daring act, though daunted and afraid;</span>
<span class="i0">Succeeding now, though partial his success,</span>
<span class="i0">And pertness mark’d his manner and address,</span>
<span class="i0">Yet such improvement issued from his books,</span>
<span class="i0">That all discern’d it in his speech and looks.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
<span class="i0">He ventured then on every theme to speak,</span>
<span class="i0">And felt no feverish tingling in his cheek;</span>
<span class="i0">His friend, approving, hail’d the happy change; <span class="linenum">350</span></span>
<span class="i0">The clerks exclaim’d&mdash;“’Tis famous, and ’tis strange.”&mdash;</span>
<span class="i2">Two years had pass’d; the youth attended still,</span>
<span class="i0">(Though thus accomplish’d) with a ready quill;</span>
<span class="i0">He sat th’ allotted hours, though hard the case,</span>
<span class="i0">While timid prudence ruled in virtue’s place;</span>
<span class="i0">By promise bound, the son his letters penn’d</span>
<span class="i0">To his good parent, at the quarter’s end.</span>
<span class="i0">At first, he sent those lines, the state to tell</span>
<span class="i0">Of his own health, and hoped his friends were well;</span>
<span class="i0">He kept their virtuous precepts in his mind, <span class="linenum">360</span></span>
<span class="i0">And needed nothing&mdash;then his name was sign’d;</span>
<span class="i0">But now he wrote of Sunday walks and views,</span>
<span class="i0">Of actors’ names, choice novels, and strange news;</span>
<span class="i0">How coats were cut, and of his urgent need</span>
<span class="i0">For fresh supply, which he desired with speed.</span>
<span class="i0">The father doubted, when these letters came,</span>
<span class="i0">To what they tended, yet was loth to blame:</span>
<span class="i0">“Stephen was once <i>my duteous son</i>, and now</span>
<span class="i0"><i>My most obedient</i>&mdash;this can I allow?</span>
<span class="i0">Can I with pleasure or with patience see <span class="linenum">370</span></span>
<span class="i0">A boy at once so heartless, and so free?”</span>
<span class="i2">But soon the kinsman heavy tidings told,</span>
<span class="i0">That love and prudence could no more withhold:</span>
<span class="i0">“Stephen, though steady at his desk, was grown</span>
<span class="i0">A rake and coxcomb&mdash;this he grieved to own;</span>
<span class="i0">His cousin left his church, and spent the day</span>
<span class="i0">Lounging about in quite a heathen way;</span>
<span class="i0">Sometimes he swore, but had indeed the grace</span>
<span class="i0">To show the shame imprinted on his face.</span>
<span class="i0">I search’d his room, and in his absence read <span class="linenum">380</span></span>
<span class="i0">Books that I knew would turn a stronger head:</span>
<span class="i0">The works of atheists half the number made,</span>
<span class="i0">The rest were lives of harlots leaving trade;</span>
<span class="i0">Which neither man nor boy would deign to read,</span>
<span class="i0">If from the scandal and pollution freed.</span>
<span class="i0">I sometimes threaten’d, and would fairly state</span>
<span class="i0">My sense of things so vile and profligate;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But I’m a cit, such works are lost on me&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">They’re knowledge, and (good Lord!) philosophy.”</span>
<span class="i2">“Oh, send him down,” the father soon replied; <span class="linenum">390</span></span>
<span class="i0">“Let me behold him, and my skill be tried:</span>
<span class="i0">If care and kindness lose their wonted use,</span>
<span class="i0">Some rougher medicine will the end produce.”</span>
<span class="i2">Stephen with grief and anger heard his doom&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“Go to the farmer? to the rustic’s home?</span>
<span class="i0">Curse the base threat’ning&mdash;” “Nay, child, never curse;</span>
<span class="i0">Corrupted long, your case is growing worse.”&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“I!” quoth the youth, “I challenge all mankind</span>
<span class="i0">To find a fault; what fault have you to find?</span>
<span class="i0">Improve I not in manner, speech, and grace? <span class="linenum">400</span></span>
<span class="i0">Inquire&mdash;my friends will tell it to your face;</span>
<span class="i0">Have I been taught to guard his kine and sheep?</span>
<span class="i0">A man like me has other things to keep;</span>
<span class="i0">This let him know.”&mdash;“It would his wrath excite;</span>
<span class="i0">But come, prepare, you must away to-night.”&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“What! leave my studies, my improvements leave,</span>
<span class="i0">My faithful friends and intimates to grieve!”&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“Go to your father, Stephen, let him see</span>
<span class="i0">All these improvements; they are lost on me.”</span>
<span class="i2">The youth, though loth, obey’d, and soon he saw <span class="linenum">410</span></span>
<span class="i0">The farmer-father, with some signs of awe:</span>
<span class="i0">Who kind, yet silent, waited to behold</span>
<span class="i0">How one would act, so daring, yet so cold;</span>
<span class="i0">And soon he found, between the friendly pair</span>
<span class="i0">That secrets pass’d which he was not to share;</span>
<span class="i0">But he resolved those secrets to obtain,</span>
<span class="i0">And quash rebellion in his lawful reign.</span>
<span class="i2">Stephen, though vain, was with his father mute;</span>
<span class="i0">He fear’d a crisis, and he shunn’d dispute;</span>
<span class="i0">And yet he long’d with youthful pride to show <span class="linenum">420</span></span>
<span class="i0">He knew such things as farmers could not know;</span>
<span class="i0">These to the grandam he with freedom spoke,</span>
<span class="i0">Saw her amazement, and enjoy’d the joke.</span>
<span class="i0">But, on the father when he cast his eye,</span>
<span class="i0">Something he found that made his valour shy;</span>
<span class="i0">And thus there seem’d to be a hollow truce,</span>
<span class="i0">Still threat’ning something dismal to produce.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
<span class="i2">Ere this the father at his leisure read</span>
<span class="i0">The son’s choice volumes, and his wonder fled;</span>
<span class="i0">He saw how wrought the works of either kind <span class="linenum">430</span></span>
<span class="i0">On so presuming, yet so weak, a mind;</span>
<span class="i0">These in a chosen hour he made his prey,</span>
<span class="i0">Condemn’d, and bore with vengeful thoughts away;</span>
<span class="i0">Then in a close recess the couple near,</span>
<span class="i0">He sat unseen to see, unheard to hear.</span>
<span class="i2">There soon a trial for his patience came;</span>
<span class="i0">Beneath were placed the youth and ancient dame,</span>
<span class="i0">Each on a purpose fix’d&mdash;but neither thought</span>
<span class="i0">How near a foe, with power and vengeance fraught.</span>
<span class="i2">And now the matron told, as tidings sad, <span class="linenum">440</span></span>
<span class="i0">What she had heard of her beloved lad;</span>
<span class="i0">How he to graceless, wicked men gave heed,</span>
<span class="i0">And wicked books would night and morning read;</span>
<span class="i0">Some former lectures she again began,</span>
<span class="i0">And begg’d attention of her little man;</span>
<span class="i0">She brought, with many a pious boast, in view</span>
<span class="i0">His former studies, and condemn’d the new:</span>
<span class="i0">Once he the names of saints and patriarchs old,</span>
<span class="i0">Judges and kings, and chiefs and prophets, told;</span>
<span class="i0">Then he in winter-nights the Bible took, <span class="linenum">450</span></span>
<span class="i0">To count how often in the sacred book</span>
<span class="i0">The sacred name appear’d, and could rehearse</span>
<span class="i0">Which were the middle chapter, word, and verse,</span>
<span class="i0">The very letter in the middle placed,</span>
<span class="i0">And so employ’d the hours that others waste.</span>
<span class="i2">“Such wert thou once; and now, my child, they say</span>
<span class="i0">Thy faith like water runneth fast away;</span>
<span class="i0">The prince of devils hath, I fear, beguiled</span>
<span class="i0">The ready wit of my backsliding child.”</span>
<span class="i2">On this, with lofty looks, our clerk began <span class="linenum">460</span></span>
<span class="i0">His grave rebuke, as he assumed the man&mdash;</span>
<span class="i2">“There is no devil,” said the hopeful youth,</span>

<h2>TALES OF THE HALL.</h2>

<p class="f110"><i>TO HER GRACE<br /> THE DUCHESS OF RUTLAND</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madam</span>,</p>

<p>It is the privilege of those who are placed in that
elevated situation to which your Grace is an ornament, that they
give honour to the person upon whom they confer a favour.
When I dedicate to your Grace the fruits of many years, and
speak of my debt to the House of Rutland, I feel that I am not
without pride in the confession nor insensible to the honour
which such gratitude implies. Forty years have elapsed since
this debt commenced. On my entrance into the cares of life,
and while contending with its difficulties, a Duke and Duchess
of Rutland observed and protected me&mdash;in my progress a Duke
and Duchess of Rutland favoured and assisted me&mdash;and, when
I am retiring from the world, a Duke and Duchess of Rutland
receive my thanks, and accept my offering. All, even in this
world of mutability, is not change: I have experienced unvaried
favour&mdash;I have felt undiminished respect.</p>

<p>With the most grateful remembrance of what I owe, and
the most sincere conviction of the little I can return, I present
these pages to your Grace’s acceptance, and beg leave to
subscribe myself,</p>

<h3>PREFACE.</h3>

<p>If I did not fear that it would appear to my readers like
arrogancy, or if it did not seem to myself indecorous to send
two volumes of considerable magnitude from the press without
preface or apology, without one petition for the reader’s
attention, or one plea for the writer’s defects, I would most
willingly spare myself an address of this kind, and more
especially for these reasons: first, because a preface is a part of
a book seldom honoured by a reader’s perusal; secondly, because
it is both difficult and distressing to write that which we think
will be disregarded; and thirdly, because I do not conceive that
I am called upon for such introductory matter by any of the
motives which usually influence an author when he composes
his prefatory address.</p>

<p>When a writer, whether of poetry or prose, first addresses
the public, he has generally something to offer which relates to
himself or to his work, and which he considers as a necessary
prelude to the work itself, to prepare his readers for the
entertainment or the instruction they may expect to receive; for one
of these every man who publishes must suppose he affords&mdash;this the
act itself implies, and in proportion to his conviction of this fact
must be his feeling of the difficulty in which he has placed himself:
the difficulty consists in reconciling the implied presumption of
the undertaking, whether to please or to instruct mankind, with the
diffidence and modesty of an untried candidate for fame or favour.
Hence originate the many reasons an author assigns for his appearance
in that character, whether they actually exist, or are merely offered
to hide the motives which cannot be openly avowed: namely, the want
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
or the vanity of the man, as his wishes for profit or reputation may
most prevail with him.</p>

<p>Now, reasons of this kind, whatever they may be, cannot
be availing beyond their first appearance. An author, it is true,
may again feel his former apprehensions, may again be elevated
or depressed by the suggestions of vanity and diffidence, and
may be again subject to the cold and hot fit of aguish expectation;
but he is no more a stranger to the press, nor has the
motives or privileges of one who is. With respect to myself, it
is certain they belong not to me. Many years have elapsed
since I became a candidate for indulgence as an inexperienced
writer; and to assume the language of such writer now, and to
plead for his indulgences, would be proof of my ignorance of
the place assigned to me, and the degree of favour which I have
experienced; but of that place I am not uninformed, and with
that degree of favour I have no reason to be dissatisfied.</p>

<p>It was the remark of the pious, but on some occasions the
querulous, author of the <i>Night Thoughts</i>, that he had “been
so long remembered, he was forgotten”&mdash;an expression in which
there is more appearance of discontent than of submission: if he
had patience, it was not the patience that <i>smiles at grief</i>.
It is not therefore entirely in the sense of the good Doctor that
I apply these words to myself, or to my more early publications.
So many years indeed have passed since their first appearance,
that I have no reason to complain, on that account, if they be
now slumbering with other poems of decent reputation in their
day&mdash;not dead indeed, nor entirely forgotten, but certainly not
the subjects of discussion or conversation as when first introduced
to the notice of the public by those whom the public will not
forget, whose protection was credit to their author, and whose
approbation was fame to them. Still these early publications
had so long preceded any other, that, if not altogether unknown,
I was, when I came again before the public, in a situation
which excused, and perhaps rendered necessary, some explanation;
but this also has passed away, and none of my readers will now
take the trouble of making any inquiries respecting my motives
for writing or for publishing these Tales or verses of any
description. Known to each other as readers and authors are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
known, they will require no preface to bespeak their good will;
nor shall I be under the necessity of soliciting the kindness
which experience has taught me, endeavouring to merit, I shall
not fail to receive.</p>

<p>There is one motive&mdash;and it is a powerful one&mdash;which
sometimes induces an author, and more particularly a poet, to
ask the attention of his readers to his prefatory address. This
is when he has some favourite and peculiar style or manner
which he would explain and defend, and chiefly if he should
have adopted a mode of versification of which an uninitiated
reader was not likely to perceive either the merit or the beauty.
In such case it is natural, and surely pardonable, to assert and
to prove, as far as reason will bear us on, that such method of
writing has both; to show in what the beauty consists, and
what peculiar difficulty there is, which, when conquered, creates
the merit. How far any particular poet has or has not succeeded
in such attempt is not my business nor my purpose to inquire:
I have no peculiar notion to defend, no poetical heterodoxy to
support, nor theory of any kind to vindicate or oppose&mdash;that
which I have used is probably the most common measure in
our language; and therefore, whatever be its advantages or
defects, they are too well known to require from me a description
of the one, or an apology for the other.</p>

<p>Perhaps still more frequent than any explanation of the
work is an account of the author himself, the situation in which
he is placed, or some circumstances of peculiar kind in his life,
education, or employment. How often has youth been pleaded
for deficiencies or redundancies, for the existence of which youth
may be an excuse, and yet be none for their exposure. Age
too has been pleaded for the errors and failings in a work which
the octogenarian had the discernment to perceive, and yet had
not the fortitude to suppress. Many other circumstances are
made apologies for a writer’s infirmities: his much employment,
and many avocations, adversity, necessity, and the good of mankind.
These, or any of them, however availing in themselves,
avail not me. I am neither so young nor so old, so much
engaged by one pursuit, or by many&mdash;I am not so urged by
want, or so stimulated by a desire of public benefit&mdash;that I can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
borrow one apology from the many which I have named. How
far they prevail with our readers, or with our judges, I cannot
tell; and it is unnecessary for me to inquire into the validity of
arguments which I have not to produce.</p>

<p>If there be any combination of circumstances which may be
supposed to affect the mind of a reader, and in some degree to
influence his judgment, the junction of youth, beauty, and merit
in a female writer may be allowed to do this; and yet one of
the most forbidding of titles is “Poems by a very young Lady”&mdash;and
this, although beauty and merit were largely insinuated.
Ladies, it is true, have of late little need of any indulgence as
authors, and names may readily be found which rather excite
the envy of man than plead for his lenity. Our estimation of
title also in a writer has materially varied from that of our
predecessors; “Poems by a Nobleman” would create a very
different sensation in our minds from that which was formerly
excited when they were so announced. A noble author had
then no pretensions to a seat so secure on the “sacred hill,”
that authors not noble, and critics not gentle, dared not attack;
and they delighted to take revenge, by their contempt and
derision of the poet, for the pain which their submission and
respect to the man had cost them. But in our times we find
that a nobleman writes, not merely as well, but better than
other men: insomuch that readers in general begin to fancy
that the Muses have relinquished their old partiality for rags and
a garret, and are become altogether aristocratical in their choice.
A conceit so well supported by fact would be readily admitted,
did it not appear at the same time, that there were in the
higher ranks of society men who could write as tamely, or as
absurdly, as they had ever been accused of doing. We may,
therefore, regard the works of any noble author as extraordinary
productions, but must not found any theory upon them; and,
notwithstanding their appearance, must look on genius and talent
as we are wont to do on time and chance, that happen indifferently
to all mankind.</p>

<p>But, whatever influence any peculiar situation of a writer
might have, it cannot be a benefit to me, who have no such
peculiarity. I must rely upon the willingness of my readers to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
be pleased with that which was designed to give them pleasure,
and upon the cordiality which naturally springs from a remembrance
of our having before parted without any feelings of
disgust on the one side, or of mortification on the other.</p>

<p>With this hope I would conclude the present subject; but
I am called upon by duty to acknowledge my obligations, and
more especially for two of the following Tales&mdash;the Story of
Lady Barbara, in Book XVI; and that of Ellen in Book XVIII.
The first of these I owe to the kindness of a fair friend, who
will, I hope, accept the thanks which I very gratefully pay, and
pardon me if I have not given to her relation the advantages
which she had so much reason to expect. The other story,
that of Ellen, could I give it in the language of him who
related it to me, would please and affect my readers. It is by
no means my only debt, though the one I now more particularly
acknowledge; for who shall describe all that he gains in the
social, the unrestrained, and the frequent conversations with a
friend, who is at once communicative and judicious&mdash;whose
opinions, on all subjects of literary kind, are founded on good
taste, and exquisite feeling? It is one of the greatest “pleasures
of my memory” to recal in absence those
conversations; and, if I do not in direct terms mention with whom I
conversed, it is both because I have no permission, and my readers
will have no doubt.</p>

<p>The first intention of the poet must be to please; for, if he
means to instruct, he must render the instruction which he
hopes to convey palatable and pleasant. I will not assume the
tone of a moralist, nor promise that my relations shall be
beneficial to mankind; but I have endeavoured, not unsuccessfully
I trust, that, in whatsoever I have related or described, there
should be nothing introduced which has a tendency to excuse
the vices of man by associating with them sentiments that
demand our respect, and talents that compel our admiration.
There is nothing in these pages which has the mischievous
effect of confounding truth and error, or confusing our ideas of
right and wrong. I know not which is most injurious to the
yielding minds of the young&mdash;to render virtue less respectable by
making its possessors ridiculous, or by describing vice with so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
many fascinating qualities, that it is either lost in the assemblage,
or pardoned by the association. Man’s heart is sufficiently
prone to make excuse for man’s infirmity, and needs not the
aid of poetry, or eloquence, to take from vice its native deformity.
A character may be respectable with all its faults, but it must
not be made respectable by them. It is grievous when genius
will condescend to place strong and evil spirits in a commanding
view, or excite our pity and admiration for men of talents,
degraded by crime, when struggling with misfortune. It is but
too true that great and wicked men may be so presented to us
as to demand our applause, when they should excite our
abhorrence; but it is surely for the interest of mankind, and
our own self-direction, that we should ever keep at unapproachable
distance our respect and our reproach.</p>

<p>I have one observation more to offer. It may appear to
some that a minister of religion, in the decline of life, should
have no leisure for such amusements as these; and for them I
have no reply. But to those who are more indulgent to the
propensities, the studies, and the habits of mankind, I offer some
apology when I produce these volumes, not as the occupations
of my life, but the fruits of my leisure&mdash;the employment of that

<span class="i0">The Brothers met who many a year had past</span>
<span class="i0">Since their last meeting, and that seem’d their last;</span>
<span class="i0">They had no parent then or common friend</span>
<span class="i0">Who might their hearts to mutual kindness bend;</span>
<span class="i0">Who, touching both in their divided state,</span>
<span class="i0">Might generous thoughts and warm desires create;</span>
<span class="i0">For there are minds whom we must first excite</span>
<span class="i0">And urge to feeling, ere they can unite;</span>
<span class="i0">As we may hard and stubborn metals beat</span>
<span class="i0">And blend together, if we duly heat. <span class="linenum">10</span></span>
<span class="i2">The elder, George, had past his threescore years,</span>
<span class="i0">A busy actor, sway’d by hopes and fears</span>
<span class="i0">Of powerful kind; and he had fill’d the parts</span>
<span class="i0">That try our strength and agitate our hearts.</span>
<span class="i0">He married not, and yet he well approved</span>
<span class="i0">The social state; but then he rashly loved;</span>
<span class="i0">Gave to a strong delusion all his youth,</span>
<span class="i0">Led by a vision till alarm’d by truth.</span>
<span class="i0">That vision past, and of that truth possest,</span>
<span class="i0">His passions wearied and disposed to rest, <span class="linenum">20</span></span>
<span class="i0">George yet had will and power a place to choose,</span>
<span class="i0">Where Hope might sleep, and terminate her views.</span>
<span class="i0">He chose his native village, and the hill</span>
<span class="i0">He climb’d a boy had its attraction still;</span>
<span class="i0">With that small brook beneath, where he would stand,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And stooping fill the hollow of his hand,</span>
<span class="i0">To quench th’ impatient thirst&mdash;then stop awhile</span>
<span class="i0">To see the sun upon the waters smile,</span>
<span class="i0">In that sweet weariness when, long denied,</span>
<span class="i0">We drink and view the fountain that supplied <span class="linenum">30</span></span>
<span class="i0">The sparkling bliss&mdash;and feel, if not express,</span>
<span class="i0">Our perfect ease in that sweet weariness.</span>
<span class="i2">The oaks yet flourish’d in that fertile ground,</span>
<span class="i0">Where still the church with lofty tower was found;</span>
<span class="i0">And still that Hall, a first, a favourite view,</span>
<span class="i0">But not the elms that form’d its avenue;</span>
<span class="i0">They fell ere George arrived, or yet had stood,</span>
<span class="i0">For he in reverence held the living wood,</span>
<span class="i0">That widely spreads in earth the deepening root,</span>
<span class="i0">And lifts to heaven the still aspiring shoot; <span class="linenum">40</span></span>
<span class="i0">From age to age they fill’d a growing space,</span>
<span class="i0">But hid the mansion they were meant to grace.</span>
<span class="i2">It was an ancient, venerable hall,</span>
<span class="i0">And once surrounded by a moat and wall;</span>
<span class="i0">A part was added by a squire of taste,</span>
<span class="i0">Who, while unvalued acres ran to waste,</span>
<span class="i0">Made spacious rooms, whence he could look about,</span>
<span class="i0">And mark improvements as they rose without:</span>
<span class="i0">He fill’d the moat, he took the wall away,</span>
<span class="i0">He thinn’d the park, and bade the view be gay. <span class="linenum">50</span></span>
<span class="i0">The scene was rich, but he who should behold</span>
<span class="i0">Its worth was poor, and so the whole was sold.</span>
<span class="i2">Just then our merchant from his desk retired,</span>
<span class="i0">And made the purchase that his heart desired&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">The Hall of Binning, his delight a boy,</span>
<span class="i0">That gave his fancy in her flight employ.</span>
<span class="i0">Here, from his father’s modest home, he gazed,</span>
<span class="i0">Its grandeur charm’d him, and its height amazed,</span>
<span class="i0">Work of past ages; and the brick-built place</span>
<span class="i0">Where he resided was in much disgrace; <span class="linenum">60</span></span>
<span class="i0">But never in his fancy’s proudest dream</span>
<span class="i0">Did he the master of that mansion seem.</span>
<span class="i0">Young was he then, and little did he know</span>
<span class="i0">What years on care and diligence bestow;</span>
<span class="i0">Now, young no more, retired to views well known,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
<span class="i0">He finds that object of his awe his own:</span>
<span class="i0">The Hall at Binning!&mdash;how he loves the gloom</span>
<span class="i0">That sun-excluding window gives the room;</span>
<span class="i0">Those broad brown stairs on which he loves to tread;</span>
<span class="i0">Those beams within; without, that length of lead, <span class="linenum">70</span></span>
<span class="i0">On which the names of wanton boys appear,</span>
<span class="i0">Who died old men, and left memorials here&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Carvings of feet and hands, and knots and flowers,</span>
<span class="i0">The fruits of busy minds in idle hours.</span>
<span class="i2">Here, while our squire the modern part possess’d,<span class="ws8">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">His partial eye upon the old would rest;<span class="ws18">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">That best his comforts gave&mdash;this sooth’d his feelings best.&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i2">Here, day by day, withdrawn from busy life,</span>
<span class="i0">No child t’ awake him, to engage no wife,</span>
<span class="i0">When friends were absent, not to books inclined, <span class="linenum">80</span></span>
<span class="i0">He found a sadness steal upon his mind;</span>
<span class="i0">Sighing the works of former lords to see,</span>
<span class="i0">“I follow them,” he cried, “but who will follow me?”</span>
<span class="i2">Some ancient men whom he a boy had known</span>
<span class="i0">He knew again; their changes were his own.</span>
<span class="i0">Comparing now he view’d them, and he felt</span>
<span class="i0">That time with him in lenient mood had dealt;</span>
<span class="i0">While some the half-distinguish’d features bore <span class="ws9">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">That he was doubtful if he saw before,<span class="ws17">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And some in memory lived, whom he must see no more. &emsp;}<span class="linenum">90</span></span>
<span class="i2">Here George had found, yet scarcely hoped to find,</span>
<span class="i0">Companions meet, minds fitted to his mind;</span>
<span class="i0">Here, late and loth, the worthy rector came,</span>
<span class="i0">From college dinners and a fellow’s fame;</span>
<span class="i0">Yet, here when fix’d, was happy to behold</span>
<span class="i0">So near a neighbour in a friend so old.</span>
<span class="i0">Boys on one form they parted, now to meet</span>
<span class="i0">In equal state, their worships on one seat.</span>
<span class="i2">Here were a sister-pair, who seem’d to live</span>
<span class="i0">With more respect than affluence can give; <span class="linenum">100</span></span>
<span class="i0">Although not affluent, they, by nature graced,</span>
<span class="i0">Had sense and virtue, dignity and taste;</span>
<span class="i0">Their minds by sorrows, by misfortunes tried,</span>
<span class="i0">Were vex’d and heal’d, were pain’d and purified.</span>
<span class="i2">Hither a sage physician came, and plann’d,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
<span class="i0">With books his guides, improvements on his land;</span>
<span class="i0">Nor less to mind than matter would he give</span>
<span class="i0">His noble thoughts, to know how spirits live,</span>
<span class="i0">And what is spirit; him his friends advised</span>
<span class="i0">To think with fear; but caution he despised; <span class="linenum">110</span></span>
<span class="i0">And hints of fear provoked him till he dared</span>
<span class="i0">Beyond himself, nor bold assertion spared,</span>
<span class="i0">But fiercely spoke, like those who strongly feel,</span>
<span class="i0">“Priests and their craft, enthusiasts and their zeal.”</span>
<span class="i2">More yet appear’d, of whom as we proceed&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Ah! yield not yet to languor&mdash;you shall read.</span>
<span class="i2">But ere the events that from this meeting rose,</span>
<span class="i0">Be they of pain or pleasure, we disclose,</span>
<span class="i0">It is of custom, doubtless is of use,</span>
<span class="i0">That we our heroes first should introduce. <span class="linenum">120</span></span>
<span class="i0">Come, then, fair Truth! and let me clearly see</span>
<span class="i0">The minds I paint, as they are seen in thee;</span>
<span class="i0">To me their merits and their faults impart;<span class="ws7">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Give me to say, “frail being! such thou art,” <span class="ws5">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And closely let me view the naked human heart.&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i2"><span class="smcap">George</span> loved to think; but, as he late began</span>
<span class="i0">To muse on all the grander thoughts of man,</span>
<span class="i0">He took a solemn and a serious view</span>
<span class="i0">Of his religion, and he found it true;</span>
<span class="i0">Firmly, yet meekly, he his mind applied <span class="linenum">130</span></span>
<span class="i0">To this great subject, and was satisfied.</span>
<span class="i2">He then proceeded, not so much intent,</span>
<span class="i0">But still in earnest, and to church he went.</span>
<span class="i0">Although they found some difference in their creed,</span>
<span class="i0">He and his pastor cordially agreed,</span>
<span class="i0">Convinced that they who would the truth obtain</span>
<span class="i0">By disputation, find their efforts vain;</span>
<span class="i0">The church he view’d as liberal minds will view,</span>
<span class="i0">And there he fix’d his principles and pew.</span>
<span class="i2">He saw&mdash;he thought he saw&mdash;how weakness, pride, <span class="linenum">140</span></span>
<span class="i0">And habit, draw seceding crowds aside:</span>
<span class="i0">Weakness, that loves on trifling points to dwell;</span>
<span class="i0">Pride, that at first from Heaven’s own worship fell;</span>
<span class="i0">And habit, going where it went before,</span>
<span class="i0">Or to the meeting or the tavern door.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
<span class="i2">George loved the cause of freedom, but reproved</span>
<span class="i0">All who with wild and boyish ardour loved:</span>
<span class="i0">Those who believed they never could be free,</span>
<span class="i0">Except when fighting for their liberty;</span>
<span class="i0">Who by their very clamour and complaint <span class="linenum">150</span></span>
<span class="i0">Invite coercion or enforce restraint.</span>
<span class="i0">He thought a trust so great, so good a cause,</span>
<span class="i0">Was only to be kept by guarding laws;</span>
<span class="i0">For, public blessings firmly to secure,</span>
<span class="i0">We must a lessening of the good endure.</span>
<span class="i0">The public waters are to none denied;</span>
<span class="i0">All drink the stream, but only few must guide.</span>
<span class="i0">There must be reservoirs to hold supply,</span>
<span class="i0">And channels form’d to send the blessing by;</span>
<span class="i0">The public good must be a private care; <span class="linenum">160</span></span>
<span class="i0">None all they would may have, but all a share.</span>
<span class="i0">So we must freedom with restraint enjoy;</span>
<span class="i0">What crowds possess they will, uncheck’d, destroy;</span>
<span class="i0">And hence, that freedom may to all be dealt,</span>
<span class="i0">Guards must be fix’d, and safety must be felt.</span>
<span class="i2">So thought our squire, nor wish’d the guards t’ appear</span>
<span class="i0">So strong, that safety might be bought too dear;</span>
<span class="i0">The constitution was the ark that he</span>
<span class="i0">Join’d to support with zeal and sanctity;</span>
<span class="i0">Nor would expose it, as th’ accursed son <span class="linenum">170</span></span>
<span class="i0">His father’s weakness, to be gazed upon.</span>
<span class="i2">“I for that freedom make,” said he, “my prayer,</span>
<span class="i0">That suits with all, like atmospheric air;</span>
<span class="i0">That is to mortal man by heaven assign’d,</span>
<span class="i0">Who cannot bear a pure and perfect kind.</span>
<span class="i0">The lighter gas, that, taken in the frame,</span>
<span class="i0">The spirit heats, and sets the blood in flame:</span>
<span class="i0">Such is the freedom which when men approve,</span>
<span class="i0">They know not what a dangerous thing they love.”</span>
<span class="i2">George chose the company of men of sense, <span class="linenum">180</span></span>
<span class="i0">But could with wit in moderate share dispense;</span>
<span class="i0">He wish’d in social ease his friends to meet,</span>
<span class="i0">When still he thought the female accent sweet;</span>
<span class="i0">Well from the ancient, better from the young,</span>
<span class="i0">He loved the lispings of the mother tongue.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
<span class="i2">He ate and drank, as much as men who think</span>
<span class="i0">Of life’s best pleasures, ought to eat or drink;</span>
<span class="i0">Men purely temperate might have taken less,</span>
<span class="i0">But still he loved indulgence, not excess;</span>
<span class="i0">Nor would alone the grants of fortune taste, <span class="linenum">190</span></span>
<span class="i0">But shared the wealth he judged it crime to waste;</span>
<span class="i0">And thus obtained the sure reward of care&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">For none can spend like him who learns to spare.</span>
<span class="i2">Time, thought, and trouble made the man appear&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">By nature shrewd&mdash;sarcastic and severe;</span>
<span class="i0">Still, he was one whom those who fully knew</span>
<span class="i0">Esteem’d and trusted, one correct and true;</span>
<span class="i0">All on his word with surety might depend,</span>
<span class="i0">Kind as a man, and faithful as a friend.</span>
<span class="i0">But him the many [knew] not, knew not cause <span class="linenum">200</span></span>
<span class="i0">In their new squire for censure or applause;</span>
<span class="i0">Ask them, “Who dwelt within that lofty wall?”</span>
<span class="i0">And they would say, “the gentleman was tall;</span>
<span class="i0">Look’d old when follow’d, but alert when met,</span>
<span class="i0">And had some vigour in his movements yet;</span>
<span class="i0">He stoops, but not as one infirm; and wears</span>
<span class="i0">Dress that becomes his station and his years.”</span>
<span class="i2">Such was the man who from the world return’d</span>
<span class="i0">Nor friend nor foe; he prized it not, nor spurn’d;</span>
<span class="i0">But came and sat him in his village down, <span class="linenum">210</span></span>
<span class="i0">Safe from its smile, and careless of its frown:</span>
<span class="i0">He, fairly looking into life’s account,</span>
<span class="i0">Saw frowns and favours were of like amount;</span>
<span class="i0">And viewing all&mdash;his perils, prospects, purse&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">He said, “Content! ’tis well it is no worse.”</span>
<span class="i2">Through ways more rough had fortune <span class="smcap">Richard</span> led,</span>
<span class="i0">The world he traversed was the book he read;</span>
<span class="i0">Hence clashing notions and opinions strange</span>
<span class="i0">Lodged in his mind: all liable to change.</span>
<span class="i2">By nature generous, open, daring, free, <span class="linenum">220</span></span>
<span class="i0">The vice he hated was hypocrisy.</span>
<span class="i0">Religious notions, in her latter years,</span>
<span class="i0">His mother gave, admonish’d by her fears;</span>
<span class="i0">To these he added, as he chanced to read</span>
<span class="i0">A pious work or learn a christian creed.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
<span class="i0">He heard the preacher by the highway side,</span>
<span class="i0">The church’s teacher, and the meeting’s guide;</span>
<span class="i0">And, mixing all their matters in his brain,</span>
<span class="i0">Distill’d a something he could ill explain;</span>
<span class="i0">But still it served him for his daily use, <span class="linenum">230</span></span>
<span class="i0">And kept his lively passions from abuse;</span>
<span class="i0">For he believed, and held in reverence high,</span>
<span class="i0">The truth so dear to man&mdash;“not all shall die.”</span>
<span class="i0">The minor portions of his creed hung loose,</span>
<span class="i0">For time to shapen and an whole produce;</span>
<span class="i0">This love effected, and a favourite maid</span>
<span class="i0">With clearer views his honest flame repaid;</span>
<span class="i0">Hers was the thought correct, the hope sublime,</span>
<span class="i0">She shaped his creed, and did the work of time.</span>
<span class="i2">He spake of freedom as a nation’s cause, <span class="linenum">240</span></span>
<span class="i0">And loved, like George, our liberty and laws;</span>
<span class="i0">But had more youthful ardour to be free,</span>
<span class="i0">And stronger fears for injured liberty.</span>
<span class="i0">With him, on various questions that arose,</span>
<span class="i0">The monarch’s servants were the people’s foes;</span>
<span class="i0">And, though he fought with all a Briton’s zeal,</span>
<span class="i0">He felt for France as Freedom’s children feel;</span>
<span class="i0">Went far with her in what she thought reform,</span>
<span class="i0">And hail’d the revolutionary storm;</span>
<span class="i0">Yet would not here, where there was least to win, <span class="linenum">250</span></span>
<span class="i0">And most to lose, the doubtful work begin;</span>
<span class="i0">But look’d on change with some religious fear,</span>
<span class="i0">And cried, with filial dread, “Ah! come not here.”</span>
<span class="i2">His friends he did not as the thoughtful choose;</span>
<span class="i0">Long to deliberate was, he judged, to lose;</span>
<span class="i0">Frankly he join’d the free, nor suffered pride</span>
<span class="i0">Or doubt to part them, whom their fate allied;</span>
<span class="i0">Men with such minds at once each other aid;<span class="ws6">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">“Frankness,” they cry, “with frankness is repaid; &emsp;&nbsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">If honest, why suspect? if poor, of what afraid?<span class="ws4">}</span><span class="linenum">260</span></span>
<span class="i0">Wealth’s timid votaries may with caution move;</span>
<span class="i0">Be it our wisdom to confide and love.”</span>
<span class="i2">So pleasures came, (not purchased first or plann’d)</span>
<span class="i0">But the chance pleasures that the poor command;</span>
<span class="i0">They came but seldom, they remain’d not long,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Nor gave him time to question “are they wrong?”</span>
<span class="i0">These he enjoy’d, and left to after time</span>
<span class="i0">To judge the folly or decide the crime;</span>
<span class="i0">Sure had he been, he had perhaps been pure</span>
<span class="i0">From this reproach&mdash;but Richard was not sure&mdash; <span class="linenum">270</span></span>
<span class="i0">Yet from the sordid vice, the mean, the base,</span>
<span class="i0">He stood aloof&mdash;death frown’d not like disgrace.</span>
<span class="i2">With handsome figure, and with manly air,</span>
<span class="i0">He pleased the sex, who all to him were fair;</span>
<span class="i0">With filial love he look’d on forms decay’d,</span>
<span class="i0">And admiration’s debt to beauty paid;</span>
<span class="i0">On sea or land, wherever Richard went,</span>
<span class="i0">He felt affection, and he found content;</span>
<span class="i0">There was in him a strong presiding hope</span>
<span class="i0">In fortune’s tempests, and it bore him up. <span class="linenum">280</span></span>
<span class="i0">But when that mystic vine his mansion graced,</span>
<span class="i0">When numerous branches round his board were placed,</span>
<span class="i0">When sighs of apprehensive love were heard&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Then first the spirit of the hero fear’d;</span>
<span class="i0">Then he reflected on the father’s part,</span>
<span class="i0">And all an husband’s sorrow touch’d his heart;</span>
<span class="i0">Then thought he, “Who will their assistance lend?</span>
<span class="i0">And be the children’s guide, the parent’s friend?</span>
<span class="i0">Who shall their guardian, their protector be?</span>
<span class="i0">I have a brother&mdash;Well!&mdash;and so has he.” <span class="linenum">290</span></span>
<span class="i2">And now they met; a message&mdash;kind, ’tis true,</span>
<span class="i0">But verbal only&mdash;ask’d an interview;</span>
<span class="i0">And many a mile, perplex’d by doubt and fear,</span>
<span class="i0">Had Richard past, unwilling to appear&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“How shall I now my unknown way explore,</span>
<span class="i0">He proud and rich&mdash;I very proud and poor?</span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps my friend a dubious speech mistook,</span>
<span class="i0">And George may meet me with a stranger’s look;</span>
<span class="i0">Then to my home when I return again, <span class="ws16">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">How shall I bear this business to explain, <span class="ws14">}</span><span class="linenum">300</span></span>
<span class="i0">And tell of hopes raised high, and feelings hurt, in vain? &emsp;}</span>
<span class="i2">“How stands the case? My brother’s friend and mine</span>
<span class="i0">Met at an inn, and sat them down to dine:</span>
<span class="i0">When, having settled all their own affairs,</span>
<span class="i0">And kindly canvass’d such as were not theirs,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Just as my friend was going to retire&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">‘Stay!&mdash;you will see the brother of our squire,’</span>
<span class="i0">Said his companion; ‘be his friend, and tell</span>
<span class="i0">The captain that his brother loves him well,</span>
<span class="i0">And, when he has no better thing in view, <span class="linenum">310</span></span>
<span class="i0">Will be rejoiced to see him. Now, adieu!’</span>
<span class="i2">Well! here I am; and, brother, take you heed,</span>
<span class="i0">I am not come to flatter you and feed;</span>
<span class="i0">You shall no soother, fawner, hearer find,</span>
<span class="i0">I will not brush your coat, nor smooth your mind;</span>
<span class="i0">I will not hear your tales the whole day long,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor swear you’re right if I believe you wrong.</span>
<span class="i0">Nor be a witness of the facts you state,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor as my own adopt your love or hate:</span>
<span class="i0">I will not earn my dinner when I dine, <span class="linenum">320</span></span>
<span class="i0">By taking all your sentiments for mine;</span>
<span class="i0">Nor watch the guiding motions of your eye,</span>
<span class="i0">Before I venture question or reply;</span>
<span class="i0">Nor when you speak affect an awe profound,</span>
<span class="i0">Sinking my voice, as if I fear’d the sound;</span>
<span class="i0">Nor to your looks obediently attend,</span>
<span class="i0">The poor, the humble, the dependant friend;</span>
<span class="i0">Yet, son of that dear mother could I meet&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">But lo! the mansion&mdash;’tis a fine old seat!”</span>
<span class="i2">The Brothers met, with both too much at heart <span class="linenum">330</span></span>
<span class="i0">To be observant of each other’s part.</span>
<span class="i0">“Brother, I’m glad,” was all that George could say,</span>
<span class="i0">Then stretch’d his hand, and turn’d his head away;</span>
<span class="i0">For he in tender tears had no delight,</span>
<span class="i0">But scorn’d the thought, and ridiculed the sight;</span>
<span class="i0">Yet now with pleasure, though with some surprise,</span>
<span class="i0">He felt his heart o’erflowing at his eyes.</span>
<span class="i2">Richard, mean time, made some attempts to speak,</span>
<span class="i0">Strong in his purpose, in his trial weak;</span>
<span class="i0">We cannot nature by our wishes rule, <span class="linenum">340</span></span>
<span class="i0">Nor at our will her warm emotions cool;&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">At length affection, like a risen tide,</span>
<span class="i0">Stood still, and then seem’d slowly to subside;</span>
<span class="i0">Each on the other’s looks had power to dwell,</span>
<span class="i0">And Brother Brother greeted passing well.</span>

<div class="poem2"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At length the Brothers met, no longer tried</span>
<span class="i0">By those strong feelings that in time subside;</span>
<span class="i0">Not fluent yet their language, but the eye</span>
<span class="i0">And action spoke both question and reply;</span>
<span class="i0">Till the heart rested, and could calmly feel;</span>
<span class="i0">Till the shook compass felt the settling steel;</span>
<span class="i0">Till playful smiles on graver converse broke,</span>
<span class="i0">And either speaker less abruptly spoke.</span>
<span class="i0">Still was there oft-times silence, silence blest,</span>
<span class="i0">Expressive, thoughtful&mdash;their emotions’ rest: <span class="linenum">10</span></span>
<span class="i0">Pauses that came not from a want of thought,</span>
<span class="i0">But want of ease, by wearied passion sought;</span>
<span class="i0">For souls, when hurried by such powerful force,</span>
<span class="i0">Rest, and retrace the pleasure of the course.</span>
<span class="i0">They differ’d much; yet might observers trace</span>
<span class="i0">Likeness of features both in mind and face;</span>
<span class="i0">Pride they possess’d, that neither strove to hide,</span>
<span class="i0">But not offensive, not obtrusive pride.</span>
<span class="i0">Unlike had been their life, unlike the fruits</span>
<span class="i0">Of different tempers, studies, and pursuits; <span class="linenum">20</span></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, in such varying scenes the men had moved,</span>
<span class="i0">’Twas passing strange that aught alike they loved.</span>
<span class="i0">But all distinction now was thrown apart,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
<span class="i0">While these strong feelings ruled in either heart.</span>
<span class="i0">As various colours in a painted ball,</span>
<span class="i0">While it has rest, are seen distinctly all,</span>
<span class="i0">Till, whirl’d around by some exterior force,</span>
<span class="i0">They all are blended in the rapid course:</span>
<span class="i0">So in repose, and not by passion sway’d,</span>
<span class="i0">We saw the difference by their habits made; <span class="linenum">30</span></span>
<span class="i0">But, tried by strong emotions, they became</span>
<span class="i0">Fill’d with one love, and were in heart the same;</span>
<span class="i0">Joy to the face its own expression sent,</span>
<span class="i0">And gave a likeness in the looks it lent.</span>
<span class="i2">All now was sober certainty; the joy</span>
<span class="i0">That no strong passions swell till they destroy:</span>
<span class="i0">For they, like wine, our pleasures raise so high,</span>
<span class="i0">That they subdue our strength, and then they die.</span>
<span class="i0">George in his brother felt a glowing pride,</span>
<span class="i0">He wonder’d who that fertile mind supplied&mdash; <span class="linenum">40</span></span>
<span class="i0">“Where could the wanderer gather on his road</span>
<span class="i0">Knowledge so various? how the mind this food?</span>
<span class="i0">No college train’d him, guideless through his life,</span>
<span class="i0">Without a friend&mdash;not so! he has a wife.</span>
<span class="i0">Ah! had I married, I might now have seen</span>
<span class="i0">My&mdash;&mdash;No! it never, never could have been,</span>
<span class="i0">That long enchantment, that pernicious state!&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">True, I recover’d, but alas! too late&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">And here is Richard, poor indeed&mdash;but&mdash;nay!</span>
<span class="i0">This is self-torment&mdash;foolish thoughts, away!” <span class="linenum">50</span></span>
<span class="i2">Ease leads to habit, as success to ease,</span>
<span class="i0">He lives by rule who lives himself to please;</span>
<span class="i0">For change is trouble, and a man of wealth</span>
<span class="i0">Consults his quiet as he guards his health;</span>
<span class="i0">And habit now on George had sovereign power,</span>
<span class="i0">His actions all had their accustom’d hour:</span>
<span class="i0">At the fix’d time he slept, he walk’d, he read,</span>
<span class="i0">Or sought his grounds, his gruel, and his bed;</span>
<span class="i0">For every season he with caution dress’d,</span>
<span class="i0">And morn and eve had the appropriate vest; <span class="linenum">60</span></span>
<span class="i0">He talk’d of early mists, and night’s cold air,</span>
<span class="i0">And in one spot was fix’d his worship’s chair.</span>
<span class="i2">But not a custom yet on Richard’s mind</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Had force, or him to certain modes confined;</span>
<span class="i0">To him no joy such frequent visits paid</span>
<span class="i0">That habit by its beaten track was made;</span>
<span class="i0">He was not one who at his ease could say,</span>
<span class="i0">“We’ll live to-morrow as we lived to-day;”</span>
<span class="i0">But he and his were as the ravens fed,</span>
<span class="i0">As the day came it brought the daily bread. <span class="linenum">70</span></span>
<span class="i2">George, born to fortune, though of moderate kind,</span>
<span class="i0">Was not in haste his road through life to find.</span>
<span class="i0">His father early lost, his mother tried<span class="ws18">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">To live without him, liked it not, and&mdash;sigh’d,<span class="ws10"> }</span></span>
<span class="i0">When, for her widow’d hand, an amorous youth applied.&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">She still was young, and felt that she could share</span>
<span class="i0">A lover’s passion, and an husband’s care;</span>
<span class="i0">Yet past twelve years before her son was told,</span>
<span class="i0">To his surprise, “your father you behold.”</span>
<span class="i0">But he beheld not with his mother’s eye <span class="linenum">80</span></span>
<span class="i0">The new relation, and would not comply,</span>
<span class="i0">But all obedience, all connexion spurn’d,</span>
<span class="i0">And fled their home, where he no more return’d.</span>
<span class="i0">His father’s brother was a man whose mind</span>
<span class="i0">Was to his business and his bank confined;</span>
<span class="i0">His guardian care the captious nephew sought,</span>
<span class="i0">And was received, caress’d, advised, and taught.</span>
<span class="i2">“That Irish beggar, whom your mother took,</span>
<span class="i0">Does you this good, he sends you to your book;</span>
<span class="i0">Yet love not books beyond their proper worth, <span class="linenum">90</span></span>
<span class="i0">But, when they fit you for the world, go forth:</span>
<span class="i0">They are like beauties, and may blessings prove,</span>
<span class="i0">When we with caution study them, or love;</span>
<span class="i0">But, when to either we our souls devote,</span>
<span class="i0">We grow unfitted for that world, and dote.”</span>
<span class="i2">George to a school of higher class was sent,</span>
<span class="i0">But he was ever grieving that he went:</span>
<span class="i0">A still, retiring, musing, dreaming boy,</span>
<span class="i0">He relish’d not their sudden bursts of joy;</span>
<span class="i0">Nor the tumultuous pleasures of a rude, <span class="linenum">100</span></span>
<span class="i0">A noisy, careless, fearless multitude.</span>
<span class="i0">He had his own delights, as one who flies</span>
<span class="i0">From every pleasure that a crowd supplies;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Thrice he return’d, but then was weary grown,</span>
<span class="i0">And was indulged with studies of his own.</span>
<span class="i2">Still could the rector and his friend relate</span>
<span class="i0">The small adventures of that distant date;</span>
<span class="i0">And Richard listen’d as they spake of time</span>
<span class="i0">Past in that world of misery and crime.</span>
<span class="i2">Freed from his school, a priest of gentle kind <span class="linenum">110</span></span>
<span class="i0">The uncle found to guide the nephew’s mind;</span>
<span class="i0">Pleased with his teacher, George so long remain’d,</span>
<span class="i0">The mind was weaken’d by the store it gain’d.</span>
<span class="i2">His guardian uncle, then on foreign ground,</span>
<span class="i0">No time to think of his improvements found;</span>
<span class="i0">Nor had the nephew, now to manhood grown,</span>
<span class="i0">Talents or taste for trade or commerce shown,</span>
<span class="i0">But shunn’d a world of which he little knew,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor of that little did he like the view.</span>
<span class="i2">His mother chose, nor I the choice upbraid, <span class="linenum">120</span></span>
<span class="i0">An Irish soldier of an house decay’d,</span>
<span class="i0">And passing poor; but, precious in her eyes</span>
<span class="i0">As she in his, they both obtain’d a prize.</span>
<span class="i0">To do the captain justice, she might share</span>
<span class="i0">What of her jointure his affairs could spare;</span>
<span class="i0">Irish he was in his profusion&mdash;true,</span>
<span class="i0">But he was Irish in affection too;</span>
<span class="i0">And, though he spent her wealth and made her grieve,</span>
<span class="i0">He always said “my dear” and “with your leave.”</span>
<span class="i0">Him she survived; she saw his boy possess’d <span class="linenum">130</span></span>
<span class="i0">Of manly spirit, and then sank to rest.</span>
<span class="i2">Her sons thus left, some legal cause required</span>
<span class="i0">That they should meet, but neither this desired.</span>
<span class="i0">George, a recluse, with mind engaged, was one</span>
<span class="i0">Who did no business, with whom none was done;</span>
<span class="i0">Whose heart, engross’d by its peculiar care,</span>
<span class="i0">Shared no one’s counsel&mdash;no one his might share.</span>
<span class="i2">Richard, a boy, a lively boy, was told</span>
<span class="i0">Of his half-brother, haughty, stern, and cold;</span>
<span class="i0">And his boy folly, or his manly pride, <span class="linenum">140</span></span>
<span class="i0">Made him on measures cool and harsh decide.</span>
<span class="i0">So, when they met, a distant cold salute</span>
<span class="i0">Was of a long-expected day the fruit;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The rest by proxies managed, each withdrew,</span>
<span class="i0">Vex’d by the business and the brother too;</span>
<span class="i0">But now they met when time had calm’d the mind;</span>
<span class="i0">Both wish’d for kindness, and it made them kind.</span>
<span class="i0">George had no wife or child, and was disposed</span>
<span class="i0">To love the man on whom his hope reposed:</span>
<span class="i0">Richard had both; and those so well beloved, <span class="linenum">150</span></span>
<span class="i0">Husband and father were to kindness moved;</span>
<span class="i0">And thus th’ affections check’d, subdued, restrain’d,</span>
<span class="i0">Rose in their force, and in their fulness reign’d.</span>
<span class="i2">The bell now bids to dine; the friendly priest,</span>
<span class="i0">Social and shrewd, the day’s delight increased.</span>
<span class="i0">Brief and abrupt their speeches while they dined,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor were their themes of intellectual kind;</span>
<span class="i0">Nor, dinner past, did they to these advance,</span>
<span class="i0">But left the subjects they discuss’d to chance.</span>
<span class="i2">Richard, whose boyhood in the place was spent, <span class="linenum">160</span></span>
<span class="i0">Profound attention to the speakers lent,</span>
<span class="i0">Who spake of men; and, as he heard a name,</span>
<span class="i0">Actors and actions to his memory came.</span>
<span class="i0">Then, too, the scenes he could distinctly trace,</span>
<span class="i0">Here he had fought, and there had gain’d a race;</span>
<span class="i0">In that church-walk he had affrighted been;</span>
<span class="i0">In that old tower he had a something seen&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">What time, dismiss’d from school, he upward cast</span>
<span class="i0">A fearful look, and trembled as he past.</span>
<span class="i2">No private tutor Richard’s parents sought, <span class="linenum">170</span></span>
<span class="i0">Made keen by hardship, and by trouble taught;</span>
<span class="i0">They might have sent him&mdash;some the counsel gave&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Seven gloomy winters of the North to brave:</span>
<span class="i0">Where a few pounds would pay for board and bed,</span>
<span class="i0">While the poor frozen boy was taught and fed;</span>
<span class="i0">When, say he lives, fair, freckled, lank and lean,</span>
<span class="i0">The lad returns shrewd, subtle, close and keen;</span>
<span class="i0">With all the northern virtues, and the rules</span>
<span class="i0">Taught to the thrifty in these thriving schools.</span>
<span class="i0">There had he gone, and borne this trying part&mdash; <span class="linenum">180</span></span>
<span class="i0">But Richard’s mother had a mother’s heart.</span>
<span class="i2">Now squire and rector were return’d to school,</span>
<span class="i0">And spoke of him who there had sovereign rule:</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
<span class="i0">He was, it seem’d, a tyrant of the sort</span>
<span class="i0">Who make the cries of tortured boys his sport;</span>
<span class="i0">One of a race, if not extinguish’d, tamed&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">The flogger now is of the act ashamed;</span>
<span class="i0">But this great mind all mercy’s calls withstood;</span>
<span class="i0">This Holofernes was a man of blood.</span>
<span class="i2">“Students,” he said, “like horses on the road, <span class="linenum">190</span></span>
<span class="i0">Must well be lash’d before they take the load;</span>
<span class="i0">They may be willing for a time to run,</span>
<span class="i0">But you must whip them ere the work be done.</span>
<span class="i0">To tell a boy, that, if he will improve,</span>
<span class="i0">His friends will praise him, and his parents love,</span>
<span class="i0">Is doing nothing&mdash;he has not a doubt</span>
<span class="i0">But they will love him, nay, applaud, without;</span>
<span class="i0">Let no fond sire a boy’s ambition trust,</span>
<span class="i0">To make him study, let him see he must.”</span>
<span class="i2">Such his opinion; and, to prove it true, <span class="linenum">200</span></span>
<span class="i0">At least sincere, it was his practice too.</span>
<span class="i0">Pluto they call’d him, and they named him well:</span>
<span class="i0">’Twas not an heaven where he was pleased to dwell.</span>
<span class="i0">From him a smile was like the Greenland sun,</span>
<span class="i0">Surprising, nay portentous, when it shone;</span>
<span class="i0">Or like the lightning, for the sudden flash</span>
<span class="i0">Prepared the children for the thunder’s crash.</span>
<span class="i2">O! had Narcissa, when she fondly kiss’d</span>
<span class="i0">The weeping boy whom she to school dismiss’d,</span>
<span class="i0">Had she beheld him shrinking from the arm <span class="linenum">210</span></span>
<span class="i0">Uplifted high to do the greater harm,</span>
<span class="i0">Then seen her darling stript, and that pure white,</span>
<span class="i0">And&mdash;O! her soul had fainted at the sight;</span>
<span class="i0">And with those looks that love could not withstand,</span>
<span class="i0">She would have cried, “Barbarian, hold thy hand!”</span>
<span class="i0">In vain! no grief to this stern soul could speak,</span>
<span class="i0">No iron-tear roll down this Pluto’s cheek.</span>
<span class="i2">Thus far they went, half earnest, half in jest,</span>
<span class="i0">Then turn’d to themes of deeper interest;</span>
<span class="i0">While Richard’s mind, that for awhile had stray’d, <span class="linenum">220</span></span>
<span class="i0">Call’d home its powers, and due attention paid.</span>

<span class="i0">We name the world a school, for day by day</span>

<span class="i0">And much, in fact, this lesser world can show</span>
<span class="i0">Of grief and crime that in the greater grow.</span>
<span class="i0">“You saw,” said George, “in that still-hated school</span>
<span class="i0">How the meek suffer, how the haughty rule;</span>

<span class="i0">Those angry passions slept till he attain’d</span>
<span class="i0">His purposed wealth, and waked when that was gain’d;</span>
<span class="i0">He then resumed the native wrath and pride,</span>

<span class="i0">Wife, children, servants, all obedience pay,</span>
<span class="i0">The slaves at school no greater slaves than they;</span>
<span class="i0">No more dependant, he resumes the rein,</span>
<span class="i0">And shows the school-boy turbulence again.</span>
<span class="i2">“Were I a poet, I would say, he brings</span>
<span class="i0">To recollection some impetuous springs;</span>
<span class="i0">See one that issues from its humble source,</span>
<span class="i0">To gain new powers, and run its noisy course:</span>

<span class="i0">With threat’ning force the new-form’d billows swell,</span>
<span class="i0">And now affright the crowd they bore so well.”</span>
<span class="i2">“Yet,” said the rector, “all these early signs</span>

<span class="i0">So he has fought, and in his country’s cause</span>

<span class="i0">Fight his good ship, and with the foe engage;</span>
<span class="i0">Nor will I quit him when the cowards fly,</span>
<span class="i0">Although, like them, I dread his energy.</span>

<span class="i0">His powers support the credit of his brains,</span>
<span class="i0">Insisting ever that he must be right,</span>
<span class="i0">And for his reasons still prepared to fight.</span>

<span class="i0">He claims a right on all things to decide,</span>

<span class="i0">Thus the boy-spirit still the bosom rules,</span>

<span class="i2">“No doubt,” said Jacques, “there are in minds the seeds</span>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
<span class="i0">That might retard the ripening of the fruit?</span>
<span class="i0">Our purpose certain, and we much effect,</span>
<span class="i0">We something cure, and something we correct;</span>
<span class="i0">But do your utmost: when the man you see,</span>

<span class="i0">Disguised a little; but we still behold</span>
<span class="i0">What pleased and what offended us of old.</span>
<span class="i0">Years from the mind no native stain remove, <span class="linenum">110</span></span>
<span class="i0">But lay the varnish of the world above.</span>
<span class="i0">Still, when he can, he loves to step aside</span>
<span class="i0">And be the boy, without a check or guide;</span>
<span class="i0">In the old wanderings he with pleasure strays,</span>
<span class="i0">And reassumes the bliss of earlier days.</span>
<span class="i2">“I left at school the boy with pensive look,</span>
<span class="i0">Whom some great patron order’d to his book;</span>
<span class="i0">Who from his mother’s cot reluctant came,</span>
<span class="i0">And gave my lord, for this compassion, fame;</span>
<span class="i0">Who, told of all his patron’s merit, sigh’d, <span class="linenum">120</span></span>
<span class="i0">I know not why, in sorrow or in pride;</span>
<span class="i0">And would, with vex’d and troubled spirit, cry,</span>

<span class="i0">Him left I with you; who, perhaps, can tell</span>
<span class="i0">If fortune bless’d him, or what fate befell.</span>
<span class="i0">I yet remember how the idlers ran</span>
<span class="i0">To see the carriage of the godlike man,</span>
<span class="i0">When pride restrain’d me; yet I thought the deed</span>
<span class="i0">Was noble, too&mdash;and how did it succeed?”</span>
<span class="i2">Jacques answer’d not till he had backward cast <span class="linenum">130</span></span>
<span class="i0">His view, and dwelt upon the evil past;</span>
<span class="i0">Then, as he sigh’d, he smil’d;&mdash;from folly rise</span>

<span class="i2">“This noble lord was one disposed to try</span>
<span class="i0">And weigh the worth of each new luxury;</span>
<span class="i0">Now, at a certain time, in pleasant mood,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
<span class="i0">He tried the luxury of doing good.</span>
<span class="i0">For this he chose a widow’s handsome boy, <span class="linenum">140</span></span>
<span class="i0">Whom he would first improve, and then employ.</span>
<span class="i0">The boy was gentle, modest, civil, kind,</span>
<span class="i0">But not for bustling through the world design’d;</span>
<span class="i0">Reserved in manner, with a little gloom,</span>
<span class="i0">Apt to retire, but never to assume;</span>
<span class="i0">Possess’d of pride that he could not subdue,</span>
<span class="i0">Although he kept his origin in view.</span>
<span class="i0">Him sent my lord to school, and this became</span>
<span class="i0">A theme for praise, and gave his lordship fame;</span>
<span class="i0">But when the boy was told how great his debt, <span class="linenum">150</span></span>
<span class="i0">He proudly ask’d, ‘is it contracted yet?’</span>
<span class="i2">“With care he studied, and with some success;</span>
<span class="i0">His patience great, but his acquirements less:</span>
<span class="i0">Yet when he heard that Charles would not excel,</span>
<span class="i0">His lordship answer’d, with a smile, ‘’tis well;</span>
<span class="i0">Let him proceed, and do the best he can,</span>
<span class="i0">I want no pedant, but a useful man.’</span>
<span class="i2">“The speech was heard, and praise was amply dealt,</span>
<span class="i0">His lordship felt it, and he said he felt&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">‘It is delightful,’ he observed, ‘to raise <span class="linenum">160</span></span>
<span class="i0">And foster merit&mdash;it is more than praise.’</span>
<span class="i2">“Five years at school th’ industrious boy had past,</span>
<span class="i0">‘And what,’ was whisper’d, ‘will be done at last?’</span>
<span class="i2">“My lord was troubled, for he did not mean</span>
<span class="i0">To have his bounty watch’d and overseen;</span>
<span class="i0">Bounty that sleeps when men applaud no more</span>
<span class="i0">The generous act that waked their praise before;</span>
<span class="i0">The deed was pleasant while the praise was new,</span>
<span class="i0">But none the progress would with wonder view.</span>
<span class="i0">It was a debt contracted; he who pays <span class="linenum">170</span></span>
<span class="i0">A debt is just, but must not look for praise:</span>
<span class="i0">The deed that once had fame must still proceed,</span>
<span class="i0">Though fame no more proclaims ‘how great the deed!’</span>
<span class="i0">The boy is taken from his mother’s side,</span>
<span class="i0">And he who took him must be now his guide.</span>
<span class="i0">But this, alas! instead of bringing fame,</span>
<span class="i0">A tax, a trouble, to my lord became.</span>
<span class="i2">“‘The boy is dull, you say,&mdash;why then by trade,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
<span class="i0">By law, by physic, nothing can be made;</span>
<span class="i0">If a small living&mdash;mine are both too large, <span class="linenum">180</span></span>
<span class="i0">And then the college is a cursed charge.</span>
<span class="i0">The sea is open; should he there display</span>
<span class="i0">Signs of dislike, he cannot run away.’</span>
<span class="i2">“Now Charles, who acted no heroic part,</span>
<span class="i0">And felt no seaman’s glory warm his heart,</span>
<span class="i0">Refused the offer&mdash;anger touch’d my lord.&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">‘He does not like it&mdash;Good, upon my word&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">If I at college place him, he will need</span>
<span class="i0">Supplies for ever, and will not succeed;&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Doubtless in me ’tis duty to provide <span class="linenum">190</span></span>
<span class="i0">Not for his comfort only, but his pride&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Let him to sea!’&mdash;He heard the words again,</span>
<span class="i0">With promise join’d&mdash;with threat’ning; all in vain:</span>
<span class="i0">Charles had his own pursuits; for aid to these</span>
<span class="i0">He had been thankful, and had tried to please;</span>
<span class="i0">But urged again, as meekly as a saint,</span>
<span class="i0">He humbly begg’d to stay at home, and paint.</span>
<span class="i0">‘Yes, pay some dauber, that this stubborn fool</span>
<span class="i0">May grind his colours, and may boast his school.’</span>
<span class="i2">“As both persisted, ‘Choose, good sir, your way,’ <span class="linenum">200</span></span>
<span class="i0">The peer exclaim’d, ‘I have no more to say,</span>
<span class="i0">I seek your good, but I have no command</span>
<span class="i0">Upon your will, nor your desire withstand.’</span>
<span class="i2">“Resolved and firm, yet dreading to offend,</span>
<span class="i0">Charles pleaded <i>genius</i> with his noble friend:</span>
<span class="i0">‘Genius!’ he cried, ‘the name that triflers give</span>
<span class="i0">To their strong wishes without pains to live;</span>
<span class="i0">Genius! the plea of all who feel desire</span>
<span class="i0">Of fame, yet grudge the labours that acquire&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">But say ’tis true: how poor, how late the gain, <span class="linenum">210</span></span>
<span class="i0">And certain ruin if the hope be vain!’</span>
<span class="i0">Then to the world appeal’d my lord, and cried,</span>
<span class="i0">‘Whatever happens, I am justified.’</span>
<span class="i0">Nay, it was trouble to his soul to find</span>
<span class="i0">There was such hardness in the human mind:</span>
<span class="i0">He wash’d his hands before the world, and swore</span>
<span class="i0">That he ‘such minds would patronize no more.’</span>
<span class="i2">“Now Charles his bread by daily labours sought,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And this his solace, ‘so Corregio wrought.’</span>
<span class="i0">Alas, poor youth! however great his name, <span class="linenum">220</span></span>
<span class="i0">And humble thine, thy fortune was the same.</span>
<span class="i0">Charles drew and painted, and some praise obtain’d</span>
<span class="i0">For care and pains; but little more was gain’d:</span>
<span class="i0">Fame was his hope, and he contempt display’d</span>
<span class="i0">For approbation, when ’twas coolly paid;</span>
<span class="i0">His daily tasks he call’d a waste of mind,</span>
<span class="i0">Vex’d at his fate, and angry with mankind:</span>
<span class="i0">‘Thus have the blind to merit ever done,</span>
<span class="i0">And Genius mourn’d for each neglected son.’</span>
<span class="i2">“Charles murmur’d thus, and, angry and alone, <span class="linenum">230</span></span>
<span class="i0">Half breathed the curse, and half suppress’d the groan;</span>
<span class="i0">Then still more sullen grew, and still more proud;<span class="ws7">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Fame so refused he to himself allow’d; <span class="ws15">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Crowds in contempt he held, and all to him was crowd. &emsp;}</span>
<span class="i2">“If aught on earth, the youth his mother loved,</span>
<span class="i0">And, at her death, to distant scenes removed.</span>
<span class="i2">“Years past away, and where he lived, and how,</span>
<span class="i0">Was then unknown&mdash;indeed we know not now;</span>
<span class="i0">But once at twilight walking up and down,</span>
<span class="i0">In a poor alley of the mighty town, <span class="linenum">240</span></span>
<span class="i0">Where, in her narrow courts and garrets, hide</span>
<span class="i0">The grieving sons of genius, want, and pride,</span>
<span class="i0">I met him musing; sadness I could trace,</span>
<span class="i0">And conquer’d hope’s meek anguish, in his face.</span>
<span class="i0">See him I must; but I with ease address’d,</span>
<span class="i0">And neither pity nor surprise express’d;</span>
<span class="i0">I strove both grief and pleasure to restrain,</span>
<span class="i0">But yet I saw that I was giving pain.</span>
<span class="i0">He said, with quick’ning pace, as loth to hold</span>
<span class="i0">A longer converse, that ‘the day was cold, <span class="linenum">250</span></span>
<span class="i0">That he was well, that I had scarcely light</span>
<span class="i0">To aid my steps,’ and bade me then good night!</span>
<span class="i2">“I saw him next where he had lately come,</span>
<span class="i0">A silent pauper in a crowded room;</span>
<span class="i0">I heard his name, but he conceal’d his face,</span>
<span class="i0">To his sad mind his misery was disgrace;</span>
<span class="i0">In vain I strove to combat his disdain</span>
<span class="i0">Of my compassion&mdash;&mdash;‘Sir, I pray, refrain;’</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
<span class="i0">For I had left my friends and stepp’d aside,</span>
<span class="i0">Because I fear’d his unrelenting pride. <span class="linenum">260</span></span>
<span class="i2">“He then was sitting on a workhouse-bed,</span>
<span class="i0">And on the naked boards reclined his head,</span>
<span class="i0">Around were children with incessant cry,</span>
<span class="i0">And near was one, like him, about to die;</span>
<span class="i0">A broken chair’s deal bottom held the store</span>
<span class="i0">That he required&mdash;he soon would need no more;</span>
<span class="i0">A yellow tea-pot, standing at his side,</span>
<span class="i0">From its half-spout the cold, black tea supplied.</span>
<span class="i2">“Hither, it seem’d, the fainting man was brought,</span>
<span class="i0">Found without food&mdash;it was no longer sought; <span class="linenum">270</span></span>
<span class="i0">For his employers knew not whom they paid,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor where to seek him whom they wish’d to aid.</span>
<span class="i0">Here brought, some kind attendant he address’d,</span>
<span class="i0">And sought some trifles which he yet possess’d;</span>
<span class="i0">Then named a lightless closet, in a room</span>
<span class="i0">Hired at small rate, a garret’s deepest gloom.</span>
<span class="i0">They sought the region, and they brought him all</span>
<span class="i0">That he his own, his proper wealth could call:</span>
<span class="i0">A better coat, less pieced; some linen neat,</span>
<span class="i0">Not whole; and papers, many a valued sheet&mdash; <span class="linenum">280</span></span>
<span class="i0">Designs and drawings; these, at his desire,</span>
<span class="i0">Were placed before him at the chamber fire,</span>
<span class="i0">And while th’ admiring people stood to gaze,</span>
<span class="i0">He, one by one, committed to the blaze,</span>
<span class="i0">Smiling in spleen; but one he held awhile,</span>
<span class="i0">And gave it to the flames, and could not smile.</span>
<span class="i2">“The sickening man&mdash;for such appear’d the fact&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Just in his need, would not a debt contract;</span>
<span class="i0">But left his poor apartment for the bed</span>
<span class="i0">That earth might yield him, or some way-side shed; <span class="linenum">290</span></span>
<span class="i0">Here he was found, and to this place convey’d,</span>
<span class="i0">Where he might rest, and his last debt be paid:</span>
<span class="i0">Fame was his wish, but he so far from fame,<span class="ws12">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">That no one knew his kindred, or his name,<span class="ws13">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Or by what means he lived, or from what place he came. &emsp;}</span>
<span class="i2">“Poor Charles! unnoticed by thy titled friend,</span>

<span class="i0">He show’d a softer feeling in his eye,</span>
<span class="i0">And watch’d my looks, and own’d the sympathy.</span>
<span class="i0">’Twas now the calm of wearied pride; so long</span>
<span class="i0">As he had strength was his resentment strong;</span>
<span class="i0">But in such place, with strangers all around,</span>

<span class="i0">Allied to his own heart, an early friend&mdash; <span class="ws8">}</span><span class="linenum">310</span></span>
<span class="i0">One, only one, who would on him attend,<span class="ws8">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">To give and take a look at this his journey’s end!&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">One link, however slender, of the chain</span>
<span class="i0">That held him where he could not long remain;</span>
<span class="i0">The one sole interest!&mdash;No, he could not now</span>
<span class="i0">Retain his anger; Nature knew not how;</span>
<span class="i0">And so there came a softness to his mind,</span>
<span class="i0">And he forgave the usage of mankind.</span>
<span class="i0">His cold long fingers now were press’d to mine,</span>
<span class="i0">And his faint smile of kinder thoughts gave sign; <span class="linenum">320</span></span>
<span class="i0">His lips moved often as he tried to lend</span>
<span class="i0">His words their sound, and softly whisper’d ‘friend!’</span>

<span class="i0">Eight days had past; the Brothers now could meet</span>
<span class="i0">With ease, and take the customary seat.</span>
<span class="i0">“These” said the host&mdash;for he perceived where stray’d</span>

<span class="i0">“These are the costly trifles that we buy,</span>

<span class="i0">And there is music; when the ladies come,</span>
<span class="i0">With their keen looks they scrutinize the room</span>
<span class="i0">To see what pleases, and I must expect</span>
<span class="i0">To yield them pleasure, or to find neglect:</span>

<span class="i2">“We must;” said Richard, “and we would not live</span>
<span class="i0">To feel what dotage and decay will give;</span>
<span class="i0">But we yet taste whatever we behold:</span>
<span class="i0">The morn is lovely, though the air is cold;</span>
<span class="i0">There is delicious quiet in this scene,</span>
<span class="i0">At once so rich, so varied, so serene; <span class="linenum">70</span></span>
<span class="i0">Sounds too delight us&mdash;each discordant tone</span>
<span class="i0">Thus mingled please, that fail to please alone:</span>
<span class="i0">This hollow wind, this rustling of the brook,<span class="ws6">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">The farm-yard noise, the woodman at yon oak&mdash; &emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">See, the axe falls!&mdash;now listen to the stroke!<span class="ws6">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">That gun itself, that murders all this peace,</span>
<span class="i0">Adds to the charm, because it soon must cease.”</span>
<span class="i2">“No doubt,” said George, “the country has its charms!</span>
<span class="i0">My farm behold! the model for all farms!</span>
<span class="i0">Look at that land&mdash;you find not there a weed, <span class="linenum">80</span></span>
<span class="i0">We grub the roots, and suffer none to seed.</span>
<span class="i0">To land like this no botanist will come,</span>
<span class="i0">To seek the precious ware he hides at home;</span>

<span class="i0">Fleece of such staple! flesh in such esteem!”</span>
<span class="i2">“Brother,” said Richard, “do I hear aright?</span>
<span class="i0">Does the land truly give so much delight?”</span>
<span class="i2">“So says my bailiff; sometimes I have tried</span>
<span class="i0">To catch the joy, but nature has denied;</span>
<span class="i0">It will not be&mdash;the mind has had a store</span>
<span class="i0">Laid up for life, and will admit no more.</span>

<span class="i0">And&mdash;here, behold my medal!&mdash;this will show</span>
<span class="i0">What men may merit when they nothing know.”</span>
<span class="i2">“Yet reason here,” said Richard, “joins with pride:&mdash;”</span>
<span class="i0">“I did not ask th’ alliance,” George replied&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“I grant it true, such trifle may induce</span>
<span class="i0">A dull, proud man to wake and be of use;</span>
<span class="i0">And there are purer pleasures, that a mind <span class="linenum">110</span></span>
<span class="i0">Calm and uninjured may in villas find;</span>
<span class="i0">But, where th’ affections have been deeply tried,</span>
<span class="i0">With other food that mind must be supplied:</span>
<span class="i0">’Tis not in trees or medals to impart</span>
<span class="i0">The powerful medicine for an aching heart;</span>
<span class="i0">The agitation dies, but there is still</span>
<span class="i0">The backward spirit, the resisting will.</span>
<span class="i0">Man takes his body to a country seat,</span>
<span class="i0">But minds, dear Richard, have their own retreat;</span>
<span class="i0">Oft when the feet are pacing o’er the green <span class="linenum">120</span></span>
<span class="i0">The mind is gone where never grass was seen,</span>
<span class="i0">And never thinks of hill, or vale, or plain,<span class="ws15">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Till want of rest creates a sense of pain, <span class="ws16">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">That calls that wandering mind, and brings it home again.&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">No more of farms; but here I boast of minds</span>
<span class="i0">That make a friend the richer when he finds:</span>
<span class="i0">These shalt thou see;&mdash;but, Richard, be it known,</span>

<span class="i2">“Brother,” said George, “I have neglected long</span>
<span class="i0">To think of all thy perils&mdash;it was wrong;</span>
<span class="i0">But do forgive me; for I could not be</span>
<span class="i0">Than of myself more negligent of thee.</span>
<span class="i0">Now tell me, Richard, from the boyish years</span>
<span class="i0">Of thy young mind, that now so rich appears, <span class="linenum">270</span></span>
<span class="i0">How was it stored? ’twas told me, thou wert wild,</span>
<span class="i0">A truant urchin, a neglected child.</span>
<span class="i0">I heard of this escape, and sat supine</span>
<span class="i0">Amid the danger that exceeded thine;</span>
<span class="i0">Thou couldst but die&mdash;the waves could but infold</span>
<span class="i0">Thy warm, gay heart, and make that bosom cold&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">While I&mdash;but no! Proceed, and give me truth;</span>
<span class="i0">How past the years of thy unguided youth?</span>
<span class="i0">Thy father left thee to the care of one</span>
<span class="i0">Who could not teach, could ill support a son; <span class="linenum">280</span></span>
<span class="i0">Yet time and trouble feeble minds have stay’d,</span>
<span class="i0">And fit for long-neglected duties made.</span>
<span class="i0">I see thee struggling in the world, as late</span>
<span class="i0">Within the waves, and, with an equal fate,</span>
<span class="i0">By Heaven preserved&mdash;but tell me, whence and how</span>
<span class="i0">Thy gleaning came?&mdash;a dexterous gleaner thou!”</span>
<span class="i2">“Left by that father, who was known to few,</span>
<span class="i0">And to that mother, who has not her due</span>
<span class="i0">Of honest fame,” said Richard, “our retreat</span>
<span class="i0">Was a small cottage, for our station meet, <span class="linenum">290</span></span>
<span class="i0">On Barford Downs; that mother, fond and poor,</span>

<span class="i0">There taught some truths, and bade me seek for more,</span>
<span class="i0">Such as our village-school and books a few</span>
<span class="i0">Supplied; but such I cared not to pursue.</span>
<span class="i0">I sought the town, and to the ocean gave</span>
<span class="i0">My mind and thoughts, as restless as the wave;</span>
<span class="i0">Where crowds assembled, I was sure to run,</span>
<span class="i0">Hear[d] what was said, and mused on what was done;</span>
<span class="i0">Attentive listening in the moving scene,</span>
<span class="i0">And often wondering what the men could mean. <span class="linenum">300</span></span>
<span class="i2">“When ships at sea made signals of their need,</span>
<span class="i0">I watch’d on shore the sailors, and their speed;</span>
<span class="i0">Mix’d in their act, nor rested till I knew</span>
<span class="i0">Why they were call’d, and what they were to do.</span>
<span class="i2">“Whatever business in the port was done,</span>
<span class="i0">I, without call, was with the busy one;</span>
<span class="i0">Not daring question, but with open ear</span>
<span class="i0">And greedy spirit, ever bent to hear.</span>
<span class="i2">“To me the wives of seamen loved to tell</span>
<span class="i0">What storms endanger’d men esteem’d so well; <span class="linenum">310</span></span>
<span class="i0">What wond’rous things in foreign parts they saw,</span>
<span class="i0">Lands without bounds, and people without law.</span>
<span class="i2">“No ships were wreck’d upon that fatal beach,</span>
<span class="i0">But I could give the luckless tale of each;</span>
<span class="i0">Eager I look’d, till I beheld a face</span>
<span class="i0">Of one disposed to paint their dismal case;</span>
<span class="i0">Who gave the sad survivors’ doleful tale,</span>
<span class="i0">From the first brushing of the mighty gale</span>
<span class="i0">Until they struck; and, suffering in their fate,</span>
<span class="i0">I long’d the more they should its horrors state; <span class="linenum">320</span></span>
<span class="i0">While some, the fond of pity, would enjoy</span>
<span class="i0">The earnest sorrows of the feeling boy.</span>
<span class="i2">“I sought the men return’d from regions cold,</span>
<span class="i0">The frozen straits, where icy mountains roll’d;</span>
<span class="i0">Some I could win to tell me serious tales</span>
<span class="i0">Of boats uplifted by enormous whales,</span>
<span class="i0">Or, when harpoon’d, how swiftly through the sea</span>
<span class="i0">The wounded monsters with the cordage flee.</span>
<span class="i0">Yet some uneasy thoughts assail’d me then:</span>
<span class="i0">The monsters warr’d not with, nor wounded, men. <span class="linenum">330</span></span>
<span class="i0">The smaller fry we take, with scales and fins,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Who gasp and die&mdash;this adds not to our sins;</span>
<span class="i0">But so much blood, warm life, and frames so large</span>
<span class="i0">To strike, to murder&mdash;seem’d an heavy charge.</span>
<span class="i2">“They told of days, where many goes to one&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Such days as ours; and how a larger sun,</span>
<span class="i0">Red, but not flaming, roll’d, with motion slow,</span>
<span class="i0">On the world’s edge, and never dropt below.</span>
<span class="i2">“There were fond girls, who took me to their side</span>
<span class="i0">To tell the story how their lovers died; <span class="linenum">340</span></span>
<span class="i0">They praised my tender heart, and bade me prove</span>
<span class="i0">Both kind and constant when I came to love.</span>
<span class="i0">In fact, I lived for many an idle year</span>
<span class="i0">In fond pursuit of agitations dear;</span>
<span class="i0">For ever seeking, ever pleased to find,</span>
<span class="i0">The food I loved, I thought not of its kind;</span>
<span class="i0">It gave affliction while it brought delight,</span>
<span class="i0">And joy and anguish could at once excite.</span>
<span class="i2">“One gusty day, now stormy and now still,</span>
<span class="i0">I stood apart upon the western hill, <span class="linenum">350</span></span>
<span class="i0">And saw a race at sea: a gun was heard,</span>
<span class="i0">And two contending boats in sail appear’d,</span>
<span class="i0">Equal awhile; then one was left behind,</span>
<span class="i0">And for a moment had her chance resign’d,</span>
<span class="i0">When, in that moment, up a sail they drew&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Not used before&mdash;their rivals to pursue.</span>
<span class="i0">Strong was the gale! in hurry now there came</span>
<span class="i0">Men from the town, their thoughts, their fears the same;</span>
<span class="i0">And women too! affrighted maids and wives,</span>
<span class="i0">All deeply feeling for their sailors’ lives. <span class="linenum">360</span></span>
<span class="i2">“The strife continued; in a glass we saw</span>
<span class="i0">The desperate efforts, and we stood in awe:</span>
<span class="i0">When the last boat shot suddenly before,</span>
<span class="i0">Then fill’d, and sank&mdash;and could be seen no more!</span>
<span class="i2">“Then were those piercing shrieks, that frantic flight,</span>
<span class="i0">All hurried! all in tumult and affright!</span>
<span class="i0">A gathering crowd from different streets drew near;</span>
<span class="i0">All ask, all answer&mdash;none attend, none hear!</span>
<span class="i2">“One boat is safe; and see! she backs her sail</span>
<span class="i0">To save the sinking&mdash;Will her care avail? <span class="linenum">370</span></span>
<span class="i2">“O! how impatient on the sands we tread,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And the winds roaring, and the women led,</span>
<span class="i0">As up and down they pace with frantic air,</span>
<span class="i0">And scorn a comforter, and will despair;</span>
<span class="i0">They know not who in either boat is gone,</span>
<span class="i0">But think the father, husband, lover, one.</span>
<span class="i2">“And who is she apart? She dares not come</span>
<span class="i0">To join the crowd, yet cannot rest at home:</span>
<span class="i0">With what strong interest looks she at the waves,</span>
<span class="i0">Meeting and clashing o’er the seamen’s graves: <span class="linenum">380</span></span>
<span class="i0">’Tis a poor girl betroth’d&mdash;a few hours more,</span>
<span class="i0">And <i>he</i> will lie a corpse upon the shore.</span>
<span class="i2">“Strange, that a boy could love these scenes, and cry</span>
<span class="i0">In very pity&mdash;but that boy was I.</span>
<span class="i0">With pain my mother would my tales receive,</span>
<span class="i0">And say, ‘my Richard, do not learn to grieve.’</span>
<span class="i2">“One wretched hour had past before we knew</span>
<span class="i0">Whom they had saved! Alas! they were but two,</span>
<span class="i0">An orphan’d lad and widow’d man&mdash;no more!</span>
<span class="i0">And they unnoticed stood upon the shore, <span class="linenum">390</span></span>
<span class="i0">With scarce a friend to greet them&mdash;widows view’d</span>
<span class="i0">This man and boy, and then their cries renew’d;&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">’Twas long before the signs of wo gave place</span>
<span class="i0">To joy again; grief sat on every face.</span>
<span class="i2">“Sure of my mother’s kindness, and the joy</span>
<span class="i0">She felt in meeting her rebellious boy,</span>
<span class="i0">I at my pleasure our new seat forsook,</span>
<span class="i0">And, undirected, these excursions took:</span>
<span class="i0">I often rambled to the noisy quay,</span>
<span class="i0">Strange sounds to hear, and business strange to me; <span class="linenum">400</span></span>
<span class="i0">Seamen and carmen, and I know not who,</span>
<span class="i0">A lewd, amphibious, rude, contentious crew&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Confused as bees appear about their hive,</span>
<span class="i0">Yet all alert to keep their work alive.</span>
<span class="i2">“Here, unobserved as weed upon the wave,</span>
<span class="i0">My whole attention to the scene I gave;</span>
<span class="i0">I saw their tasks, their toil, their care, their skill,</span>
<span class="i0">Led by their own and by a master-will;</span>
<span class="i0">And, though contending, toiling, tugging on,</span>
<span class="i0">The purposed business of the day was done. <span class="linenum">410</span></span>
<span class="i2">“The open shops of craftsmen caught my eye,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And there my questions met the kind reply:</span>
<span class="i0">Men, when alone, will teach; but, in a crowd,</span>
<span class="i0">The child is silent, or the man is proud;</span>
<span class="i0">But, by themselves, there is attention paid</span>
<span class="i0">To a mild boy, so forward, yet afraid.</span>
<span class="i2">“I made me interest at the inn’s fire-side,</span>
<span class="i0">Amid the scenes to bolder boys denied;</span>
<span class="i0">For I had patrons there, and I was one,</span>
<span class="i0">They judged, who noticed nothing that was done. <span class="linenum">420</span></span>
<span class="i0">‘A quiet lad!’ would my protector say;</span>
<span class="i0">‘To him, now, this is better than his play:</span>
<span class="i0">Boys are as men; some active, shrewd, and keen,</span>
<span class="i0">They look about if aught is to be seen;</span>
<span class="i0">And some, like Richard here, have not a mind</span>
<span class="i0">That takes a notice&mdash;but the lad is kind.’</span>
<span class="i2">“I loved in summer on the heath to walk,</span>
<span class="i0">And seek the shepherd&mdash;shepherds love to talk.</span>
<span class="i0">His superstition was of ranker kind,</span>
<span class="i0">And he with tales of wonder stored my mind; <span class="linenum">430</span></span>
<span class="i0">Wonders that he in many a lonely eve</span>
<span class="i0">Had seen, himself, and therefore must believe.</span>
<span class="i0">His boy, his Joe, he said, from duty ran,</span>
<span class="i0">Took to the sea, and grew a fearless man:</span>
<span class="i0">‘On yonder knoll&mdash;the sheep were in the fold&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">His spirit past me, shivering-like and cold!</span>
<span class="i0">I felt a fluttering, but I knew not how,</span>
<span class="i0">And heard him utter, like a whisper, ‘now!’</span>
<span class="i0">Soon came a letter from a friend&mdash;to tell</span>
<span class="i0">That he had fallen, and the time he fell.’ <span class="linenum">440</span></span>
<span class="i2">“Even to the smugglers’ hut the rocks between,</span>
<span class="i0">I have, adventurous in my wandering, been.</span>
<span class="i0">Poor, pious Martha served the lawless tribe,</span>
<span class="i0">And could their merits and their faults describe;</span>
<span class="i0">Adding her thoughts; ‘I talk, my child, to you,</span>
<span class="i0">Who little think of what such wretches do.’</span>
<span class="i2">“I loved to walk where none had walk’d before,</span>
<span class="i0">About the rocks that ran along the shore;</span>
<span class="i0">Or far beyond the sight of men to stray,</span>
<span class="i0">And take my pleasure when I lost my way; <span class="linenum">450</span></span>
<span class="i0">For then ’twas mine to trace the hilly heath,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And all the mossy moor that lies beneath:</span>
<span class="i0">Here had I favourite stations, where I stood</span>
<span class="i0">And heard the murmurs of the ocean-flood,</span>
<span class="i0">With not a sound beside, except when flew</span>
<span class="i0">Aloft the lapwing, or the gray curlew,</span>
<span class="i0">Who with wild notes my fancied power defied,</span>
<span class="i0">And mock’d the dreams of solitary pride.</span>
<span class="i2">“I loved to stop at every creek and bay</span>
<span class="i0">Made by the river in its winding way, <span class="linenum">460</span></span>
<span class="i0">And call to memory&mdash;not by marks they bare,</span>
<span class="i0">But by the thoughts that were created there.</span>
<span class="i2">“Pleasant it was to view the sea-gulls strive</span>
<span class="i0">Against the storm, or in the ocean dive,</span>
<span class="i0">With eager scream, or when they dropping gave</span>
<span class="i0">Their closing wings to sail upon the wave:</span>
<span class="i0">Then, as the winds and waters raged around,</span>
<span class="i0">And breaking billows mix’d their deafening sound,</span>
<span class="i0">They on the rolling deep securely hung,</span>
<span class="i0">And calmly rode the restless waves among. <span class="linenum">470</span></span>
<span class="i0">Nor pleased it less around me to behold,</span>
<span class="i0">Far up the beach, the yesty sea-foam roll’d;</span>
<span class="i0">Or, from the shore upborn, to see on high</span>
<span class="i0">Its frothy flakes in wild confusion fly;</span>
<span class="i0">While the salt spray that clashing billows form,</span>
<span class="i0">Gave to the taste a feeling of the storm.</span>
<span class="i2">“Thus, with my favourite views, for many an hour</span>
<span class="i0">Have I indulged the dreams of princely power;</span>
<span class="i0">When the mind, weaned by excursions bold,</span>
<span class="i0">The fancy jaded, and the bosom cold, <span class="linenum">480</span></span>
<span class="i0">Or when those wants that will on kings intrude,</span>
<span class="i0">Or evening-fears, broke in on solitude;</span>
<span class="i0">When I no more my fancy could employ, <span class="ws4">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">I left in haste what I could not enjoy,<span class="ws8">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And was my gentle mother’s welcome boy. &emsp;}</span>
<span class="i2">“But now thy walk,&mdash;this soft autumnal gloom</span>
<span class="i0">Bids no delay&mdash;at night I will resume</span>
<span class="i0">My subject, showing, not how I improved</span>
<span class="i0">In my strange school, but what the things I loved,</span>
<span class="i0">My first-born friendships, ties by forms uncheck’d, <span class="linenum">490</span></span>
<span class="i0">And all that boys acquire whom men neglect.”</span>

<span class="i2">“South in the port, and eastward in the street,</span>

<span class="i0">The home they fill’d; a part of them were dead,</span>
<span class="i0">Married a part, while some at sea remain’d,</span>

<span class="i0">Lord of some petty craft, by night and day,</span>

<span class="i0">I read, and doubly was I paid to hear</span>
<span class="i0">Events that fell upon no listless ear:</span>
<span class="i0">She grieved to say her parents could neglect</span>
<span class="i0">Her education!&mdash;’twas a sore defect;</span>
<span class="i0">She, who had ever such a vast delight</span>

<span class="i0">But hear she could, and from our stores I took,</span>
<span class="i0">Librarian meet! at her desire our book.</span>
<span class="i0">Full twenty volumes&mdash;I would not exceed</span>

<span class="i0">The rest&mdash;for some of other kinds remain’d,</span>
<span class="i0">And these a board beneath the shelf contain’d&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Had their deficiencies in part; they lack’d</span>
<span class="i0">One side or both, or were no longer back’d; <span class="linenum">30</span></span>
<span class="i0">But now became degraded from their place,</span>

<span class="i0">For relaxation&mdash;food for different minds;</span>
<span class="i0">A piece of Wingate&mdash;thanks for all we have&mdash;</span>

<span class="i2">“History we had&mdash;wars, treasons, treaties, crimes,</span>
<span class="i0">From Julius Cæsar to the present times;</span>
<span class="i0">Questions and answers, teaching what to ask</span>

<span class="i0">A scholar’s book it was, who, giving, swore</span>

<span class="i0">Seen, though but dimly, in the doleful nights,</span>
<span class="i0">When the good wife her wintry vigil keeps,</span>

<span class="i2">“Add to all these our works in single sheets,</span>

<span class="i0">But peace again is fled; the teacher comes,</span>
<span class="i0">And new importance, haughtier air assumes.</span>
<span class="i2">No hapless victim of a tyrant’s love <span class="linenum">410</span></span>
<span class="i0">More keenly felt, or more resisting strove</span>
<span class="i0">Against her fate; she look’d on every side,</span>
<span class="i0">But there were none to help her, none to guide;&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">And he, the man who should have taught the soul,</span>
<span class="i0">Wish’d but the body in his base control.</span>
<span class="i2">She left her infant on the Sunday morn,</span>
<span class="i0">A creature doom’d to shame! in sorrow born;</span>
<span class="i0">A thing that languished, nor arrived at age</span>
<span class="i0">When the man’s thoughts with sin and pain engage&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">She came not home to share our humble meal, <span class="linenum">420</span></span>
<span class="i0">Her father thinking what his child would feel</span>
<span class="i0">From his hard sentence&mdash;still she came not home.</span>
<span class="i0">The night grew dark, and yet she was not come;</span>
<span class="i0">The east-wind roar’d, the sea return’d the sound,</span>
<span class="i0">And the rain fell as if the world were drown’d;</span>
<span class="i0">There were no lights without, and my good man,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
<span class="i0">To kindness frighten’d, with a groan began</span>
<span class="i0">To talk of Ruth, and pray; and then he took</span>
<span class="i0">The Bible down, and read the holy book;</span>
<span class="i0">For he had learning; and when that was done <span class="linenum">430</span></span>
<span class="i0">We sat in silence&mdash;whither could we run?</span>
<span class="i0">We said, and then rush’d frighten’d from the door,</span>
<span class="i0">For we could bear our own conceit no more;</span>
<span class="i0">We call’d on neighbours&mdash;there she had not been;</span>
<span class="i0">We met some wanderers&mdash;ours they had not seen;</span>
<span class="i0">We hurried o’er the beach, both north and south,</span>
<span class="i0">Then join’d, and wander’d to our haven’s mouth,</span>
<span class="i0">Where rush’d the falling waters wildly out:</span>
<span class="i0">I scarcely heard the good man’s fearful shout,</span>
<span class="i0">Who saw a something on the billow ride, <span class="linenum">440</span></span>
<span class="i0">And ‘Heaven have mercy on our sins!’ he cried,</span>
<span class="i1">‘It is my child!’ and to the present hour</span>
<span class="i0">So he believes&mdash;and spirits have the power.</span>
<span class="i2">And she was gone! the waters wide and deep</span>
<span class="i0">Roll’d o’er her body as she lay asleep.</span>
<span class="i0">She heard no more the angry waves and wind,</span>
<span class="i0">She heard no more the threatening of mankind;</span>
<span class="i0">Wrapt in dark weeds, the refuse of the storm,</span>
<span class="i0">To the hard rock was borne her comely form!</span>
<span class="i2">But O! what storm was in that mind? what strife, <span class="linenum">450</span></span>
<span class="i0">That could compel her to lay down her life?</span>
<span class="i0">For she was seen within the sea to wade,</span>
<span class="i0">By one at distance, when she first had pray’d;</span>
<span class="i0">Then to a rock within the hither shoal</span>
<span class="i0">Softly and with a fearful step she stole;</span>
<span class="i0">Then, when she gain’d it, on the top she stood</span>
<span class="i0">A moment still&mdash;and dropt into the flood!</span>
<span class="i0">The man cried loudly, but he cried in vain&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">She heard not then&mdash;she never heard again!</span>
<span class="i0">She had&mdash;pray, Heav’n!&mdash;she had that world in sight, <span class="linenum">460</span></span>
<span class="i0">Where frailty mercy finds, and wrong has right;</span>
<span class="i0">But, sure, in this her portion such has been,</span>
<span class="i0">Well had it still remain’d a world unseen!’</span>
<span class="i1">Thus far the dame: the passions will dispense</span>
<span class="i0">To such a wild and rapid eloquence&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Will to the weakest mind their strength impart,</span>
<span class="i0">And give the tongue the language of the heart.”</span>

<span class="i0">“This then, dear Richard, was the way you took</span>
<span class="i0">To gain instruction&mdash;thine a curious book,</span>
<span class="i0">Containing much of both the false and true;</span>
<span class="i0">But thou hast read it, and with profit too.</span>
<span class="i2">“Come, then, my Brother, now thy tale complete&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">I know thy first embarking in the fleet,</span>
<span class="i0">Thy entrance in the army, and thy gain</span>
<span class="i0">Of plenteous laurels in the wars in Spain,</span>
<span class="i0">And what then follow’d; but I wish to know</span>
<span class="i0">When thou that heart hadst courage to bestow, <span class="linenum">10</span></span>
<span class="i0">When to declare it gain’d, and when to stand</span>
<span class="i0">Before the priest, and give the plighted hand;</span>
<span class="i0">So shall I boldness from thy frankness gain</span>
<span class="i0">To paint the frenzy that possessed my brain;</span>
<span class="i0">For rather there than in my heart I found</span>
<span class="i0">Was my disease; a poison, not a wound,</span>
<span class="i0">A madness, Richard&mdash;but, I pray thee, tell</span>
<span class="i0">Whom hast thou loved so dearly and so well?”</span>
<span class="i2">The younger man his gentle host obey’d,</span>
<span class="i0">For some respect, though not required, was paid; <span class="linenum">20</span></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps with all that independent pride</span>
<span class="i0">Their different states would to the memory glide;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Yet was his manner unconstrain’d and free,</span>
<span class="i0">And nothing in it like servility.</span>
<span class="i2">Then he began:&mdash;“When first I reach’d the land,</span>
<span class="i0">I was so ill that death appear’d at hand;</span>
<span class="i0">And, though the fever left me, yet I grew</span>
<span class="i0">So weak ’twas judged that life would leave me too.</span>
<span class="i0">I sought a village-priest, my mother’s friend,</span>
<span class="i0">And I believed with him my days would end: <span class="linenum">30</span></span>
<span class="i0">The man was kind, intelligent, and mild,</span>
<span class="i0">Careless and shrewd, yet simple as the child;</span>
<span class="i0">For of the wisdom of the world his share</span>
<span class="i0">And mine were equal&mdash;neither had to spare;</span>
<span class="i0">Else&mdash;with his daughters, beautiful and poor&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">He would have kept a sailor from his door.</span>
<span class="i0">Two then were present, who adorn’d his home,</span>
<span class="i0">But ever speaking of a third to come;</span>
<span class="i0">Cheerful they were, not too reserved or free,</span>
<span class="i0">I loved them both, and never wish’d them three. <span class="linenum">40</span></span>
<span class="i2">“The vicar’s self, still further to describe,</span>
<span class="i0">Was of a simple, but a studious tribe;</span>
<span class="i0">He from the world was distant, not retired,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor of it much possess’d, nor much desired:</span>
<span class="i0">Grave in his purpose, cheerful in his eye,</span>
<span class="i0">And with a look of frank benignity.</span>
<span class="i0">He lost his wife when they together past</span>
<span class="i0">Years of calm love, that triumph’d to the last.</span>
<span class="i0">He much of nature, not of man, had seen,</span>
<span class="i0">Yet his remarks were often shrewd and keen; <span class="linenum">50</span></span>
<span class="i0">Taught not by books t’ approve or to condemn,</span>
<span class="i0">He gain’d but little that he knew from them;</span>
<span class="i0">He read with reverence and respect the few,</span>
<span class="i0">Whence he his rules and consolations drew;</span>
<span class="i0">But men and beasts, and all that lived or moved,</span>
<span class="i0">Were books to him; he studied them and loved.</span>
<span class="i2">“He knew the plants in mountain, wood, or mead;</span>
<span class="i0">He knew the worms that on the foliage feed;</span>
<span class="i0">Knew the small tribes that ’scape the careless eye,</span>
<span class="i0">The plant’s disease that breeds the embryo-fly; <span class="linenum">60</span></span>
<span class="i0">And the small creatures who on bark or bough</span>
<span class="i0">Enjoy their changes, changed we know not how;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But now th’ imperfect being scarcely moves,</span>
<span class="i0">And now takes wing and seeks the sky it loves.</span>
<span class="i2">“He had no system, and forbore to read</span>
<span class="i0">The learned labours of th’ immortal Swede;</span>
<span class="i0">But smiled to hear the creatures he had known</span>
<span class="i0">So long, were now in class and order shown,</span>
<span class="i0">Genus and species&mdash;‘is it meet,’ said he,</span>
<span class="i0">‘This creature’s name should one so sounding be? <span class="linenum">70</span></span>
<span class="i0">Tis but a fly, though first-born of the spring&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Bombylius majus, dost thou call the thing?</span>
<span class="i0">Majus, indeed! and yet, in fact, ’tis true,<span class="ws12">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">We all are majors, all are minors too, <span class="ws14">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Except the first and last&mdash;th’ immensely distant two.&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">And here again&mdash;what call the learned this?</span>
<span class="i0">Both Hippobosca and Hirundinis?</span>
<span class="i0">Methinks the creature should be proud to find</span>
<span class="i0">That he employs the talents of mankind;</span>
<span class="i0">And that his sovereign master shrewdly looks, <span class="linenum">80</span></span>
<span class="i0">Counts all his parts, and puts them in his books.</span>
<span class="i0">Well! go thy way, for I do feel it shame</span>
<span class="i0">To stay a being with so proud a name.’</span>
<span class="i2">“Such were his daughters, such my quiet friend,</span>
<span class="i0">And pleasant was it thus my days to spend;</span>
<span class="i0">But when Matilda at her home I saw,</span>
<span class="i0">Whom I beheld with anxiousness and awe,</span>
<span class="i0">The ease and quiet that I found before</span>
<span class="i0">At once departed, and return’d no more.</span>
<span class="i0">No more their music soothed me as they play’d, <span class="linenum">90</span></span>
<span class="i0">But soon her words a strong impression made:</span>
<span class="i0">The sweet enthusiast, so I deem’d her, took</span>
<span class="i0">My mind, and fix’d it to her speech and look;</span>
<span class="i0">My soul, dear girl! she made her constant care,&nbsp;&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">But never whisper’d to my heart ‘beware!’<span class="ws6">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">In love no dangers rise till we are in the snare.<span class="ws3">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Her father sometimes question’d of my creed,</span>
<span class="i0">And seem’d to think it might amendment need;</span>
<span class="i0">But great the difference when the pious maid</span>
<span class="i0">To the same errors her attention paid: <span class="linenum">100</span></span>
<span class="i0">Her sole design that I should think aright,</span>
<span class="i0">And my conversion her supreme delight.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Pure was her mind, and simple her intent,</span>
<span class="i0">Good all she sought, and kindness all she meant.</span>
<span class="i0">Next to religion friendship was our theme,</span>
<span class="i0">Related souls and their refined esteem.</span>
<span class="i0">We talk’d of scenes where this is real found,</span>
<span class="i0">And love subsists without a dart or wound;</span>
<span class="i0">But there intruded thoughts not all serene,</span>
<span class="i0">And wishes not so calm would intervene.” <span class="linenum">110</span></span>
<span class="i2">“Saw not her father?”</span>
<span class="i24">“Yes; but saw no more</span>
<span class="i0">Than he had seen without a fear before:</span>
<span class="i0">He had subsisted by the church and plough,</span>
<span class="i0">And saw no cause for apprehension now.</span>
<span class="i0">We, too, could live; he thought not passion wrong,</span>
<span class="i0">But only wonder’d we delay’d so long.</span>
<span class="i0">More had he wonder’d had he known esteem</span>
<span class="i0">Was all we mention’d, friendship was our theme.&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Laugh, if you please, I must my tale pursue&mdash;<span class="ws6">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">This sacred friendship thus in secret grew <span class="ws9">}</span><span class="linenum">120</span></span>
<span class="i0">An intellectual love, most tender, chaste, and true; &emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">Unstain’d, we said; nor knew we how it chanced</span>
<span class="i0">To gain some earthly soil as it advanced;</span>
<span class="i0">But yet my friend, and she alone, could prove</span>
<span class="i0">How much it differ’d from romantic love&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">But this and more I pass&mdash;No doubt, at length,</span>
<span class="i0">We could perceive the weakness of our strength.</span>
<span class="i2">“O! days remember’d well! remember’d all!</span>
<span class="i0">The bitter-sweet, the honey and the gall;</span>
<span class="i0">Those garden rambles in the silent night, <span class="linenum">130</span></span>
<span class="i0">Those trees so shady, and that moon so bright;</span>
<span class="i0">That thickset alley, by the arbour closed,</span>
<span class="i0">That woodbine seat where we at last reposed;</span>
<span class="i0">And then the hopes that came and then were gone,</span>
<span class="i0">Quick as the clouds beneath the moon passed on.</span>
<span class="i0">Now, in this instant, shall my love be shown,</span>
<span class="i0">I said&mdash;O! no, the happy time is flown!</span>
<span class="i2">“You smile; remember, I was weak and low,</span>
<span class="i0">And fear’d the passion as I felt it grow:</span>
<span class="i0">Will she, I said, to one so poor attend, <span class="linenum">140</span></span>
<span class="i0">Without a prospect, and without a friend?</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
<span class="i0">I dared not ask her&mdash;till a rival came,</span>
<span class="i0">But hid the secret, slow-consuming flame.</span>
<span class="i2">I once had seen him; then familiar, free,</span>
<span class="i0">More than became a common guest to be;</span>
<span class="i0">And sure, I said, he has a look of pride</span>
<span class="i0">And inward joy&mdash;a lover satisfied.</span>
<span class="i2">Can you not, Brother, on adventures past</span>
<span class="i0">A thought, as on a lively prospect, cast?</span>
<span class="i0">On days of dear remembrance! days that seem, <span class="linenum">150</span></span>
<span class="i0">When past&mdash;nay, even when present&mdash;like a dream?</span>
<span class="i0">These white and blessed days, that softly shine</span>
<span class="i0">On few, nor oft on them&mdash;have they been thine?”</span>
<span class="i1">George answer’d, “Yes! dear Richard, through the years</span>
<span class="i0">Long past, a day so white and mark’d appears.</span>
<span class="i0">As in the storm that pours destruction round,</span>
<span class="i0">Is here and there a ship in safety found:</span>
<span class="i0">So in the storms of life some days appear</span>
<span class="i0">More blest and bright for the preceding fear.</span>
<span class="i0">These times of pleasure that in life arise, <span class="linenum">160</span></span>
<span class="i0">Like spots in deserts, that delight, surprise,</span>
<span class="i0">And to our wearied senses give the more,</span>
<span class="i0">For all the waste behind us and before&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">And thou, dear Richard, hast then had thy share</span>
<span class="i0">Of those enchanting times that baffle care?”</span>
<span class="i2">Yes, I have felt this life-refreshing gale</span>
<span class="i0">That bears us onward when our spirits fail;</span>
<span class="i0">That gives those spirits vigour and delight&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">I would describe it, could I do it right.</span>
<span class="i2">Such days have been&mdash;a day of days was one <span class="linenum">170</span></span>
<span class="i0">When, rising gaily with the rising sun,</span>
<span class="i0">I took my way to join a happy few,</span>
<span class="i0">Known not to me, but whom Matilda knew,</span>
<span class="i0">To whom she went a guest, and message sent:</span>
<span class="i1">Come thou to us;’ and as a guest I went.</span>
<span class="i0">There are two ways to Brandon&mdash;by the heath</span>
<span class="i0">Above the cliff, or on the sand beneath,</span>
<span class="i0">Where the small pebbles, wetted by the wave,</span>
<span class="i0">To the new day reflected lustre gave.</span>
<span class="i0">At first above the rocks I made my way, <span class="linenum">180</span></span>
<span class="i0">Delighted looking at the spacious bay,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And the large fleet that to the northward steer’d</span>
<span class="i0">Full sail, that glorious in my view appear’d;</span>
<span class="i0">For where does man evince his full control</span>
<span class="i0">O’er subject matter, where displays the soul</span>
<span class="i0">Its mighty energies with more effect</span>
<span class="i0">Than when her powers that moving mass direct?</span>
<span class="i0">Than when man guides the ship man’s art has made,</span>
<span class="i0">And makes the winds and waters yield him aid?</span>
<span class="i2">“Much as I long’d to see the maid I loved, <span class="linenum">190</span></span>
<span class="i0">Through scenes so glorious I at leisure moved;</span>
<span class="i0">For there are times when we do not obey</span>
<span class="i0">The master-passion&mdash;when we yet delay&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">When absence, soon to end, we yet prolong,</span>
<span class="i0">And dally with our wish although so strong.</span>
<span class="i2">“High were my joys, but they were sober too,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor reason spoil’d the pictures fancy drew;</span>
<span class="i0">I felt&mdash;rare feeling in a world like this&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">The sober certainty of waking bliss;</span>
<span class="i0">Add too the smaller aids to happy men, <span class="linenum">200</span></span>
<span class="i0">Convenient helps&mdash;these too were present then.</span>
<span class="i2">“But what are spirits? light indeed and gay <span class="ws6">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">They are, like winter flowers, nor last a day; <span class="ws7">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Comes a rude icy wind&mdash;they feel, and fade away. &emsp;}</span>
<span class="i2">“High beat my heart when to the house I came,</span>
<span class="i0">And when the ready servant gave my name;</span>
<span class="i0">But when I enter’d that pernicious room,</span>
<span class="i0">Gloomy it look’d, and painful was the gloom;</span>
<span class="i0">And jealous was the pain, and deep the sigh</span>
<span class="i0">Caused by this gloom, and pain, and jealousy: <span class="linenum">210</span></span>
<span class="i0">For there Matilda sat, and her beside</span>
<span class="i0">That rival soldier, with a soldier’s pride;</span>
<span class="i0">With self-approval in his laughing face,</span>
<span class="i0">His seem’d the leading spirit of the place.</span>
<span class="i0">She was all coldness&mdash;yet I thought a look,</span>
<span class="i0">But that corrected, tender welcome spoke:</span>
<span class="i0">It was as lightning which you think you see,</span>
<span class="i0">But doubt, and ask if lightning it could be.</span>
<span class="i2">“Confused and quick my introduction pass’d,</span>
<span class="i0">When I, a stranger and on strangers cast, <span class="linenum">220</span></span>
<span class="i0">Beheld the gallant man as he display’d</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Uncheck’d attention to the guilty maid.</span>
<span class="i0">O! how it grieved me that she dared t’ excite</span>
<span class="i0">Those looks in him that show’d so much delight;</span>
<span class="i0">Egregious coxcomb! there&mdash;he smiled again,</span>
<span class="i0">As if he sought to aggravate my pain;</span>
<span class="i0">Still she attends&mdash;I must approach&mdash;and find,</span>
<span class="i0">Or make, a quarrel, to relieve my mind.</span>
<span class="i2">“In vain I try&mdash;politeness as a shield</span>
<span class="i0">The angry strokes of my contempt repell’d; <span class="linenum">230</span></span>
<span class="i0">Nor must I violate the social law</span>
<span class="i0">That keeps the rash and insolent in awe.</span>
<span class="i0">Once I observed, on hearing my replies,</span>
<span class="i0">The woman’s terror fix’d on me the eyes</span>
<span class="i0">That look’d entreaty; but the guideless rage</span>
<span class="i0">Of jealous minds no softness can assuage.</span>
<span class="i0">But, lo! they rise, and all prepare to take</span>
<span class="i0">The promised pleasure on the neighbouring lake.</span>
<span class="i2">“Good heaven! they whisper! Is it come to this?</span>
<span class="i0">Already!&mdash;then may I my doubt dismiss: <span class="linenum">240</span></span>
<span class="i0">Could he so soon a timid girl persuade?</span>
<span class="i0">What rapid progress has the coxcomb made!</span>
<span class="i0">And yet how cool her looks, and how demure!</span>
<span class="i0">The falling snow nor lily’s flower so pure&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">What can I do? I must the pair attend,</span>
<span class="i0">And watch this horrid business to its end.</span>
<span class="i2">“There, forth they go! He leads her to the shore&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Nay, I must follow&mdash;I can bear no more:</span>
<span class="i0">What can the handsome gipsy have in view</span>
<span class="i0">In trifling thus, as she appears to do? <span class="linenum">250</span></span>
<span class="i0">I, who for months have labour’d to succeed,</span>
<span class="i0">Have only lived her vanity to feed.</span>

<span class="i0">Like discontent, that, though corrected, dwelt</span>
<span class="i0">On that dear face, and told me what she felt.</span>
<span class="i2">“Now must we cross the lake, and as we cross’d</span>

<span class="i0">They both are ours, with all they bring, for life,</span>
<span class="i0">’Tis not in us t’ expel or gout or wife;</span>
<span class="i0">On man a kind of dignity they shed,</span>
<span class="i0">A sort of gloomy pomp about his bed;</span>
<span class="i0">Then, if he leaves them, go where’er he will,</span>

<span class="i0">Has she not cherish’d every moment’s bliss,</span>
<span class="i0">And made an Eden of a world like this?</span>
<span class="i0">When Care would strive with us his watch to keep,</span>

<span class="i0">Wrote verse, it may be, and for one dear maid</span>

<span class="i0">Thine was a frailty,&mdash;folly, if you please&mdash; <span class="linenum">60</span></span>
<span class="i0">But mine a flight, a madness, a disease.</span>
<span class="i2">“Turn with me to my twentieth year, for then</span>
<span class="i0">The lover’s frenzy ruled the poet’s pen;</span>
<span class="i0">When virgin reams were soil’d with lays of love,</span>
<span class="i0">The flinty hearts of fancied nymphs to move:</span>
<span class="i0">Then was I pleased in lonely ways to tread,</span>
<span class="i0">And muse on tragic tales of lovers dead;</span>
<span class="i0">For all the merit I could then descry</span>
<span class="i0">In man or woman was for love to die.</span>
<span class="i2">“I mused on charmers chaste, who pledged their truth, <span class="linenum">70</span></span>
<span class="i0">And left no more the once-accepted youth;</span>
<span class="i0">Though he disloyal, lost, diseased, became,</span>
<span class="i0">The widow’d turtle’s was a deathless flame.</span>
<span class="i0">This faith, this feeling, gave my soul delight:</span>
<span class="i0">Truth in the lady, ardour in the knight.</span>
<span class="i2">“I built me castles wondrous rich and rare,</span>
<span class="i0">Few castle-builders could with me compare;</span>
<span class="i0">The hall, the palace, rose at my command,</span>
<span class="i0">And these I fill’d with objects great and grand.</span>
<span class="i0">Virtues sublime, that nowhere else would live, <span class="linenum">80</span></span>
<span class="i0">Glory and pomp, that I alone could give;</span>
<span class="i0">Trophies and thrones, by matchless valour gain’d,</span>
<span class="i0">Faith unreproved, and chastity unstain’d;</span>
<span class="i0">With all that soothes the sense and charms the soul,</span>
<span class="i0">Came at my call, and were in my control.</span>
<span class="i2">“And who was I? a slender youth and tall,</span>
<span class="i0">In manner awkward, and with fortune small;</span>
<span class="i0">With visage pale; my motions quick and slow,</span>
<span class="i0">That fall and rising in the spirits show;</span>
<span class="i0">For none could more by outward signs express <span class="linenum">90</span></span>
<span class="i0">What wise men lock within the mind’s recess.</span>
<span class="i0">Had I a mirror set before my view,</span>
<span class="i0">I might have seen what such a form could do;</span>
<span class="i0">Had I within the mirror truth beheld,</span>
<span class="i0">I should have such presuming thoughts repell’d:</span>
<span class="i0">But, awkward as I was, without the grace</span>
<span class="i0">That gives new beauty to a form or face,</span>

<span class="i2">“Assured of this, that love’s delicious bond <span class="linenum">100</span></span>
<span class="i0">Would hold me ever faithful, ever fond,</span>
<span class="i0">It seem’d but just that I in love should find</span>
<span class="i0">A kindred heart as constant and as kind.</span>
<span class="i0">Give me, I cried, a beauty: none on earth</span>
<span class="i0">Of higher rank or nobler in her birth;</span>
<span class="i0">Pride of her race, her father’s hope and care,</span>
<span class="i0">Yet meek as children of the cottage are;</span>
<span class="i0">Nursed in the court, and there by love pursued,</span>
<span class="i0">But fond of peace, and blest in solitude;</span>
<span class="i0">By rivals honour’d, and by beauties praised, <span class="linenum">110</span></span>
<span class="i0">Yet all unconscious of the envy raised.</span>
<span class="i0">Suppose her this, and from attendants freed,</span>
<span class="i0">To want my prowess in a time of need,</span>
<span class="i0">When safe and grateful she desires to show</span>
<span class="i0">She feels the debt that she delights to owe,</span>
<span class="i0">And loves the man who saved her in distress&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">So fancy will’d, nor would compound for less.</span>
<span class="i2">“This was my dream.&mdash;In some auspicious hour,</span>
<span class="i0">In some sweet solitude, in some green bower,</span>
<span class="i0">Whither my fate should lead me, there, unseen, <span class="linenum">120</span></span>
<span class="i0">I should behold my fancy’s gracious queen,</span>
<span class="i0">Singing sweet song! that I should hear awhile,</span>
<span class="i0">Then catch the transient glory of a smile;</span>
<span class="i0">Then at her feet with trembling hope should kneel,</span>
<span class="i0">Such as rapt saints and raptured lovers feel:</span>
<span class="i0">To watch the chaste unfoldings of her heart,</span>
<span class="i0">In joy to meet, in agony to part,</span>
<span class="i0">And then in tender song to soothe my grief,</span>
<span class="i0">And hail, in glorious rhyme, my <i>Lady of the Leaf</i>.</span>
<span class="i2">“To dream these dreams I chose a woody scene, <span class="linenum">130</span></span>
<span class="i0">My guardian-shade, the world and me between;</span>
<span class="i0">A green inclosure, where beside its bound</span>
<span class="i0">A thorny fence beset its beauties round,</span>
<span class="i0">Save where some creature’s force had made a way</span>
<span class="i0">For me to pass, and in my kingdom stray.</span>
<span class="i0">Here then I stray’d, then sat me down to call,</span>
<span class="i0">Just as I will’d, my shadowy subjects all!</span>
<span class="i0">Fruits of all minds conceived on every coast&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Fay, witch, enchanter, devil, demon, ghost;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And thus with knights and nymphs, in halls and bowers, <span class="linenum">140</span></span>
<span class="i0">In war and love, I pass’d unnumber’d hours.</span>
<span class="i0">Gross and substantial beings all forgot,<span class="ws14">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Ideal glories beam’d around the spot, <span class="ws15">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And all that was, with me, of this poor world was not.&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i2">“Yet in this world there was a single scene,</span>
<span class="i0">That I allow’d with mine to intervene.</span>
<span class="i0">This house, where never yet my feet had stray’d,</span>
<span class="i0">I with respect and timid awe survey’d;</span>
<span class="i0">With pleasing wonder I have oft-times stood,</span>
<span class="i0">To view these turrets rising o’er the wood; <span class="linenum">150</span></span>
<span class="i0">When fancy to the halls and chambers flew,</span>
<span class="i0">Large, solemn, silent, that I must not view;</span>
<span class="i0">The moat was then, and then o’er all the ground</span>
<span class="i0">Tall elms and ancient oaks stretch’d far around;</span>
<span class="i0">And where the soil forbad the nobler race,</span>
<span class="i0">Dwarf trees and humbler shrubs had found their place,</span>
<span class="i0">Forbidding man in their close hold to go,</span>
<span class="i0">Haw, gatter, holm, the service and the sloe;</span>
<span class="i0">With tangling weeds that at the bottom grew,</span>
<span class="i0">And climbers all above their feathery branches threw. <span class="linenum">160</span></span>
<span class="i0">Nor path of man or beast was there espied;<span class="ws12">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">But there the birds of darkness loved to hide,<span class="ws10">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">The loathed toad to lodge, and speckled snake to glide.&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i2">“To me this hall, thus view’d in part, appear’d</span>
<span class="i0">A mansion vast. I wonder’d, and I fear’d.</span>
<span class="i0">There as I wander’d, fancy’s forming eye</span>
<span class="i0">Could gloomy cells and dungeons dark espy;</span>
<span class="i0">Winding through these, I caught th’ appalling sound<span class="ws7">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Of troubled souls, that guilty minds confound,<span class="ws12">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Where murder made its way, and mischief stalk’d around. &emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">Above the roof were raised the midnight storms, <span class="linenum">171</span></span>
<span class="i0">And the wild lights betray’d the shadowy forms.</span>
<span class="i2">“With all these flights and fancies, then so dear,</span>
<span class="i0">I reach’d the birth-day of my twentieth year;</span>

<span class="i0">Much, but not all; truth help’d to make their slave.</span>
<span class="i0">For she was lovely, all was not the vain</span>
<span class="i0">Or sickly homage of a fever’d brain;</span>
<span class="i0">No! she had beauty, such as they admire</span>

<span class="i0">Imagination might her aid bestow,</span>

<span class="i0">The condescending looks, that spoke the nobler race.&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">Slender she was and tall; her fairy-feet</span>

<span class="i0">To come, nor let her friend th’ adventure share;</span>

<span class="i2">“I was in doubt: ’twas sore disgrace, I knew,</span>

<span class="i0">As fire electric, when discharged, will strike</span>

<span class="i0">Was strongly fix’d, and likely to remain; <span class="linenum">320</span></span>
<span class="i0">Listening, I grew enamour’d of the sound,</span>

<span class="i0">I felt those helps that souls diseased restore,</span>
<span class="i0">And that cold frenzy, avarice, raged no more.</span>
<span class="i0">From dreams of boundless wealth I then arose;&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">This place, the scene of infant bliss, I chose;<span class="ws4">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And here I find relief, and here I seek repose. <span class="ws3">}</span></span>
<span class="i2">“Yet much is lost, and not yet much is found,</span>
<span class="i0">But what remains, I would believe, is sound: <span class="linenum">820</span></span>
<span class="i0">That first wild passion, that last mean desire,</span>
<span class="i0">Are felt no more; but holier hopes require</span>
<span class="i0">A mind prepared and steady&mdash;my reform</span>
<span class="i0">Has fears like his, who, suffering in a storm,</span>
<span class="i0">Is on a rich but unknown country cast,</span>
<span class="i0">The future fearing, while he feels the past;</span>
<span class="i0">But whose more cheerful mind, with hope imbued,</span>
<span class="i0">Sees through receding clouds the rising good.”</span>

<span class="i0">The morning shone in cloudless beauty bright;</span>
<span class="i0">Richard his letters read with much delight;</span>
<span class="i0">George from his pillow rose in happy tone,</span>
<span class="i0">His bosom’s lord sat lightly on his throne.</span>
<span class="i0">They read the morning news&mdash;they saw the sky</span>
<span class="i0">Inviting call’d them, and the earth was dry.</span>
<span class="i2">“The day invites us, brother,” said the ’squire;</span>
<span class="i0">“Come, and I’ll show thee something to admire:</span>
<span class="i0">We still may beauty in our prospects trace;</span>
<span class="i0">If not, we have them in both mind and face. <span class="linenum">10</span></span>
<span class="i2">“’Tis but two miles&mdash;to let such women live</span>
<span class="i0">Unseen of him, what reason can I give?</span>
<span class="i0">Why should not Richard to the girls be known?</span>
<span class="i0">Would I have all their friendship for my own?&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Brother, there dwell, yon northern hill below,</span>
<span class="i0">Two favourite maidens, whom ’tis good to know;</span>
<span class="i0">Young, but experienced; dwellers in a cot,</span>
<span class="i0">Where they sustain and dignify their lot;</span>
<span class="i0">The best good girls in all our world below&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">O! you must know them&mdash;Come! and you shall know. <span class="linenum">20</span></span>
<span class="i2">“But lo! the morning wastes&mdash;here, Jacob, stir&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">If Phœbe comes, do you attend to her;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And let not Mary get a chattering press</span>
<span class="i0">Of idle girls to hear of her distress.</span>
<span class="i0">Ask her to wait till my return&mdash;and hide</span>
<span class="i0">From her meek mind your plenty and your pride;</span>
<span class="i0">Nor vex a creature, humble, sad, and still,</span>
<span class="i0">By your coarse bounty, and your rude good-will.”</span>
<span class="i2">This said, the brothers hasten’d on their way,</span>
<span class="i0">With all the foretaste of a pleasant day. <span class="linenum">30</span></span>
<span class="i0">The morning purpose in the mind had fix’d</span>
<span class="i0">The leading thought, and that with others mix’d.</span>
<span class="i2">“How well it is,” said George, “when we possess</span>
<span class="i0">The strength that bears us up in our distress;</span>
<span class="i0">And need not the resources of our pride,</span>
<span class="i0">Our fall from greatness and our wants to hide;</span>
<span class="i0">But have the spirit and the wish to show,</span>
<span class="i0">We know our wants as well as others know.</span>
<span class="i0">’Tis true, the rapid turns of fortune’s wheel</span>
<span class="i0">Make even the virtuous and the humble feel: <span class="linenum">40</span></span>
<span class="i0">They for a time must suffer, and but few</span>
<span class="i0">Can bear their sorrows and our pity too.</span>
<span class="i2">“Hence all these small expedients, day by day,</span>
<span class="i0">Are used to hide the evils they betray:</span>
<span class="i0">When, if our pity chances to be seen,<span class="ws14">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">The wounded pride retorts, with anger keen, <span class="ws8">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And man’s insulted grief takes refuge in his spleen. &emsp;}</span>
<span class="i2">“When Timon’s board contains a single dish,</span>
<span class="i0">Timon talks much of market-men and fish,</span>
<span class="i0">Forgetful servants, and th’ infernal cook, <span class="linenum">50</span></span>
<span class="i0">Who always spoil’d whate’er she undertook.</span>
<span class="i2">“But say it tries us from our height to fall,</span>
<span class="i0">Yet is not life itself a trial all?</span>
<span class="i0">And not a virtue in the bosom lives,</span>
<span class="i0">That gives such ready pay as patience gives;</span>
<span class="i0">That pure submission to the ruling mind,</span>
<span class="i0">Fix’d, but not forced; obedient, but not blind,</span>
<span class="i0">The will of heaven to make her own she tries,</span>
<span class="i0">Or makes her own to heaven a sacrifice.</span>
<span class="i2">“And is there aught on earth so rich or rare, <span class="linenum">60</span></span>
<span class="i0">Whose pleasures may with virtue’s pains compare?</span>
<span class="i0">This fruit of patience, this the pure delight</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
<span class="i0">That ’tis a trial in her Judge’s sight;</span>
<span class="i0">Her part still striving duty to sustain,</span>
<span class="i0">Not spurning pleasure, not defying pain;</span>
<span class="i0">Never in triumph till her race be won,</span>
<span class="i0">And never fainting till her work be done.”</span>
<span class="i2">With thoughts like these they reach’d the village brook,</span>
<span class="i0">And saw a lady sitting with her book;</span>
<span class="i0">And so engaged she heard not, till the men <span class="linenum">70</span></span>
<span class="i0">Were at her side, nor was she frighten’d then;</span>
<span class="i0">But to her friend, the ’squire, his smile return’d,</span>
<span class="i0">Through which the latent sadness he discern’d.</span>
<span class="i0">The stranger-brother at the cottage door</span>
<span class="i0">Was now admitted, and was strange no more;</span>
<span class="i0">Then of an absent sister he was told,</span>
<span class="i0">Whom they were not at present to behold;</span>
<span class="i0">Something was said of nerves, and that disease,</span>
<span class="i0">Whose varying powers on mind and body seize,</span>
<span class="i0">Enfeebling both!&mdash;Here chose they to remain <span class="linenum">80</span></span>
<span class="i0">One hour in peace, and then return’d again.</span>
<span class="i2">“I know not why,” said Richard, “but I feel</span>
<span class="i0">The warmest pity on my bosom steal</span>
<span class="i0">For that dear maid! How well her looks express</span>
<span class="i0">For this world’s good a cherish’d hopelessness!</span>
<span class="i0">A resignation that is so entire,</span>
<span class="i0">It feels not now the stirrings of desire;</span>
<span class="i0">What now to her is all the world esteems?</span>
<span class="i0">She is awake, and cares not for its dreams;</span>
<span class="i0">But moves while yet on earth, as one above <span class="linenum">90</span></span>
<span class="i0">Its hopes and fears&mdash;it[s] loathing and its love.</span>
<span class="i2">“But shall I learn,” said he, “these sisters’ fate?”&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">And found his brother willing to relate.</span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">“The girls were orphans early; yet I saw,</span>
<span class="i0">When young, their father&mdash;his profession law;</span>
<span class="i0">He left them but a competence, a store</span>
<span class="i0">That made his daughters neither rich nor poor;</span>
<span class="i0">Not rich, compared with some who dwelt around;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Not poor, for want they neither fear’d nor found;</span>
<span class="i0">Their guardian uncle was both kind and just, <span class="linenum">100</span></span>
<span class="i0">One whom a parent might in dying trust;</span>
<span class="i0">Who, in their youth, the trusted store improved,</span>
<span class="i0">And, when he ceased to guide them, fondly loved.</span>
<span class="i2">“These sister beauties were in fact the grace</span>
<span class="i0">Of yon small town,&mdash;it was their native place;</span>
<span class="i0">Like Saul’s famed daughters were the lovely twain,</span>
<span class="i0">As Micah, Lucy, and as Merab, Jane:</span>
<span class="i0">For this was tall, with free commanding air,</span>
<span class="i0">And that was mild, and delicate, and fair.</span>
<span class="i2">“Jane had an arch delusive smile, that charm’d <span class="linenum">110</span></span>
<span class="i0">And threaten’d too; alluring, it alarm’d;</span>
<span class="i0">The smile of Lucy her approval told,</span>
<span class="i0">Cheerful, not changing; neither kind nor cold.</span>
<span class="i2">“When children, Lucy love alone possess’d,</span>
<span class="i0">Jane was more punished and was more caress’d;</span>
<span class="i0">If told the childish wishes, one bespoke</span>
<span class="i0">A lamb, a bird, a garden, and a brook;</span>
<span class="i0">The other wish’d a joy unknown, a rout</span>
<span class="i0">Or crowded ball, and to be first led out.</span>
<span class="i2">“Lucy loved all that grew upon the ground, <span class="linenum">120</span></span>
<span class="i0">And loveliness in all things living found;</span>
<span class="i0">The gilded fly, the fern upon the wall,</span>
<span class="i0">Were nature’s works, and admirable all;</span>
<span class="i0">Pleased with indulgence of so cheap a kind,</span>
<span class="i0">Its cheapness never discomposed her mind.</span>
<span class="i2">“Jane had no liking for such things as these,</span>
<span class="i0">Things pleasing her must her superiors please;</span>
<span class="i0">The costly flower was precious in her eyes,</span>
<span class="i0">That skill can vary, or that money buys;</span>
<span class="i0">Her taste was good, but she was still afraid, <span class="linenum">130</span></span>
<span class="i0">Till fashion sanction’d the remarks she made.</span>
<span class="i2">“The sisters read, and Jane with some delight,</span>
<span class="i0">The satires keen that fear or rage excite,</span>
<span class="i0">That men in power attack, and ladies high,</span>
<span class="i0">And give broad hints that we may know them by.</span>
<span class="i0">She was amused when sent to haunted rooms,</span>
<span class="i0">Or some dark passage where the spirit comes</span>
<span class="i0">Of one once murder’d! then she laughing read,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And felt at once the folly and the dread.</span>
<span class="i0">As rustic girls to crafty gipsies fly, <span class="linenum">140</span></span>
<span class="i0">And trust the liar though they fear the lie,</span>
<span class="i0">Or as a patient, urged by grievous pains,</span>
<span class="i0">Will fee the daring quack whom he disdains:</span>
<span class="i0">So Jane was pleased to see the beckoning hand,</span>
<span class="i0">And trust the magic of the Ratcliffe-wand.</span>
<span class="i2">“In her religion&mdash;for her mind, though light,</span>
<span class="i0">Was not disposed our better views to slight&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Her favourite authors were a solemn kind,</span>
<span class="i0">Who fill with dark mysterious thoughts the mind;</span>
<span class="i0">And who with such conceits her fancy plied, <span class="linenum">150</span></span>
<span class="i0">Became her friend, philosopher, and guide.</span>
<span class="i2">“She made the Progress of the Pilgrim one</span>
<span class="i0">To build a thousand pleasant views upon;</span>
<span class="i0">All that connects us with a world above</span>
<span class="i0">She loved to fancy, and she long’d to prove;</span>
<span class="i0">Well would the poet please her, who could lead</span>
<span class="i0">Her fancy forth, yet keep untouch’d her creed.</span>
<span class="i2">“Led by an early custom, Lucy spied,</span>
<span class="i0">When she awaked, the Bible at her side;</span>
<span class="i0">That, ere she ventured on a world of care,<span class="ws7">}</span><span class="linenum">160</span></span>
<span class="i0">She might for trials, joys or pains prepare, <span class="ws6">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">For every dart a shield, a guard for every snare. &emsp;}</span>
<span class="i2">“She read not much of high heroic deeds,</span>
<span class="i0">Where man the measure of man’s power exceeds;</span>
<span class="i0">But gave to luckless love and fate severe</span>
<span class="i0">Her tenderest pity and her softest tear.</span>
<span class="i2">“She mix’d not faith with fable, but she trod</span>
<span class="i0">Right onward, cautious in the ways of God;</span>
<span class="i0">Nor did she dare to launch on seas unknown,<span class="ws10">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">In search of truths by some adventurers shown,<span class="ws8">}</span><span class="linenum">170</span></span>
<span class="i0">But her own compass used, and kept a course her own.&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i2">“The maidens both their loyalty declared,</span>
<span class="i0">And in the glory of their country shared;</span>
<span class="i0">But Jane that glory felt with proud delight,</span>
<span class="i0">When England’s foes were vanquish’d in the fight;</span>
<span class="i0">While Lucy’s feelings for the brave who bled</span>
<span class="i0">Put all such glorious triumphs from her head.</span>
<span class="i2">“They both were frugal; Lucy from the fear</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Of wasting that which want esteems so dear,</span>
<span class="i0">But finds so scarce, her sister from the pain <span class="linenum">180</span></span>
<span class="i0">That springs from want, when treated with disdain.</span>
<span class="i2">“Jane borrow’d maxims from a doubting school,</span>
<span class="i0">And took for truth the test of ridicule;</span>
<span class="i0">Lucy saw no such virtue in a jest:</span>
<span class="i0">Truth was with her of ridicule a test.</span>
<span class="i2">“They loved each other with the warmth of youth,</span>
<span class="i0">With ardour, candour, tenderness, and truth;</span>
<span class="i0">And, though their pleasures were not just the same,</span>
<span class="i0">Yet both were pleased whenever one became;</span>
<span class="i0">Nay, each would rather in the act rejoice, <span class="linenum">190</span></span>
<span class="i0">That was th’ adopted, not the native choice.</span>
<span class="i2">“Each had a friend, and friends to minds so fond</span>
<span class="i0">And good are soon united in the bond;</span>
<span class="i0">Each had a lover; but it seem’d that fate</span>
<span class="i0">Decreed that these should not approximate.</span>
<span class="i0">Now Lucy’s lover was a prudent swain,</span>
<span class="i0">And thought, in all things, what would be his gain;</span>
<span class="i0">The younger sister first engaged his view,</span>
<span class="i0">But with her beauty he her spirit knew;</span>
<span class="i0">Her face he much admired, ‘but, put the case,’ <span class="linenum">200</span></span>
<span class="i0">Said he, ‘I marry, what is then a face?</span>
<span class="i0">At first it pleases to have drawn the lot;</span>
<span class="i0">He then forgets it, but his wife does not;</span>
<span class="i0">Jane too,’ he judged, ‘would be reserved and nice,</span>
<span class="i0">And many lovers had enhanced her price.’</span>
<span class="i2">“Thus thinking much, but hiding what he thought,</span>
<span class="i0">The prudent lover Lucy’s favour sought,</span>
<span class="i0">And he succeeded&mdash;she was free from art,</span>
<span class="i0">And his appear’d a gentle guileless heart;</span>
<span class="i0">Such she respected; true, her sister found <span class="linenum">210</span></span>
<span class="i0">His placid face too ruddy and too round,</span>
<span class="i0">Too cold and inexpressive; such a face</span>
<span class="i0">Where you could nothing mark’d or manly trace.</span>
<span class="i2">“But Lucy found him to his mother kind,</span>
<span class="i0">And saw the Christian meekness of his mind;</span>
<span class="i0">His voice was soft, his temper mild and sweet,</span>
<span class="i0">His mind was easy, and his person neat.</span>
<span class="i2">“Jane said he wanted courage; Lucy drew</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
<span class="i0">No ill from that, though she believed it too;</span>
<span class="i0">‘It is religious, Jane, be not severe;’ <span class="linenum">220</span></span>
<span class="i0">‘Well, Lucy, then it is religious fear,’</span>
<span class="i0">Nor could the sister, great as was her love,</span>
<span class="i0">A man so lifeless and so cool approve.</span>
<span class="i2">“Jane had a lover, whom a lady’s pride</span>
<span class="i0">Might wish to see attending at her side,</span>
<span class="i0">Young, handsome, sprightly, and with good address,</span>
<span class="i0">Not mark’d for folly, error or excess;</span>
<span class="i0">Yet not entirely from their censure free</span>
<span class="i0">Who judge our failings with severity.</span>
<span class="i0">The very care he took to keep his name <span class="linenum">230</span></span>
<span class="i0">Stainless, with some was evidence of shame.</span>
<span class="i2">“Jane heard of this, and she replied, ‘Enough;</span>
<span class="i0">Prove but the facts, and I resist not proof;</span>
<span class="i0">Nor is my heart so easy as to love</span>
<span class="i0">The man my judgment bids me not approve.’</span>
<span class="i0">But yet that heart a secret joy confess’d,</span>
<span class="i0">To find no slander on the youth would rest;</span>
<span class="i0">His was, in fact, such conduct, that a maid</span>
<span class="i0">Might think of marriage, and be not afraid;</span>
<span class="i0">And she was pleased to find a spirit high, <span class="linenum">240</span></span>
<span class="i0">Free from all fear, that spurn’d hypocrisy.</span>
<span class="i2">“‘What fears my sister?’ said the partial fair,</span>
<span class="i0">For Lucy fear’d,&mdash;‘Why tell me to beware?</span>
<span class="i0">No smooth deceitful varnish can I find; <span class="ws11">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">His is a spirit generous, free, and kind;<span class="ws12">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And all his flaws are seen, all floating in his mind. &emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">A little boldness in his speech. What then?</span>
<span class="i0">It is the failing of these generous men.</span>
<span class="i0">A little vanity, but&mdash;O! my dear,</span>
<span class="i0">They all would show it, were they all sincere. <span class="linenum">250</span></span>
<span class="i2">“‘But come, agreed; we’ll lend each other eyes</span>
<span class="i0">To see our favourites, when they wear disguise;</span>
<span class="i0">And all those errors that will then be shown</span>
<span class="i0">Uninfluenced by the workings of our own.’</span>
<span class="i2">“Thus lived the sisters, far from power removed,</span>
<span class="i0">And far from need, both loving and beloved.</span>
<span class="i0">Thus grew, as myrtles grow; I grieve at heart</span>
<span class="i0">That I have pain and sorrow to impart.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But so it is, the sweetest herbs that grow</span>
<span class="i0">In the lone vale, where sweetest waters flow, <span class="linenum">260</span></span>
<span class="i0">Ere drops the blossom, or appears the fruit,</span>
<span class="i0">Feel the vile grub, and perish at the root;</span>
<span class="i0">And, in a quick and premature decay,</span>
<span class="i0">Breathe the pure fragrance of their life away.</span>
<span class="i2">“A town was near, in which the buildings all</span>
<span class="i0">Were large, but one pre-eminently tall&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">An huge high house. Without there was an air</span>
<span class="i0">Of lavish cost; no littleness was there;</span>
<span class="i0">But room for servants, horses, whiskies, gigs,</span>
<span class="i0">And walls for pines and peaches, grapes and figs; <span class="linenum">270</span></span>
<span class="i0">Bright on the sloping glass the sunbeams shone,</span>
<span class="i0">And brought the summer of all climates on.</span>
<span class="i2">“Here wealth its prowess to the eye display’d,</span>
<span class="i0">And here advanced the seasons, there delay’d;</span>
<span class="i0">Bid the due heat each growing sweet refine,<span class="ws5">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Made the sun’s light with grosser fire combine,&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">And to the Tropic gave the vigour of the Line.<span class="ws3">}</span></span>
<span class="i2">“Yet, in the master of this wealth behold <span class="ws16">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">A light vain coxcomb taken from his gold,<span class="ws17">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Whose busy brain was weak, whose boasting heart was cold.&emsp;}<span class="linenum">280</span></span>
<span class="i0">O! how he talk’d to that believing town,</span>
<span class="i0">That he would give it riches and renown;</span>
<span class="i0">Cause a canal where treasures were to swim,</span>
<span class="i0">And they should owe their opulence to him!</span>
<span class="i0">In fact, of riches he insured a crop,</span>
<span class="i0">So they would give him but a seed to drop.</span>
<span class="i0">As used the alchymist his boasts to make,</span>
<span class="i0">‘I give you millions for the mite I take:’</span>
<span class="i0">The mite they never could again behold,</span>
<span class="i0">The millions all were Eldorado gold. <span class="linenum">290</span></span>
<span class="i2">“By this professing man the country round</span>
<span class="i0">Was search’d to see where money could be found.</span>
<span class="i2">“The thriven farmer, who had lived to spare,</span>
<span class="i0">Became an object of especial care;</span>
<span class="i0">He took the frugal tradesman by the hand,</span>
<span class="i0">And wish’d him joy of what he might command;</span>
<span class="i0">And the industrious servant, who had laid</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
<span class="i0">His saving by, it was his joy to aid;</span>
<span class="i0">Large talk, and hints of some productive plan</span>
<span class="i0">Half named, won all his hearers to a man; <span class="linenum">300</span></span>
<span class="i0">Uncertain projects drew them wondering on,</span>
<span class="i0">And avarice listen’d till distrust was gone.</span>
<span class="i0">But when to these dear girls he found his way,</span>
<span class="i0">All easy, artless, innocent were they;</span>
<span class="i0">When he compelled his foolish wife to be</span>
<span class="i0">At once so great, so humble, and so free;</span>
<span class="i0">Whom others sought, nor always with success!</span>
<span class="i0">But they were both her pride and happiness;</span>
<span class="i0">And she esteem’d them, but attended still</span>
<span class="i0">To the vile purpose of her husband’s will; <span class="linenum">310</span></span>
<span class="i0">And, when she fix’d his snares about their mind,</span>
<span class="i0">Respected those whom she essay’d to blind;</span>
<span class="i0">Nay with esteem she some compassion gave</span>
<span class="i0">To the fair victims whom she would not save.</span>
<span class="i2">“The Banker’s wealth and kindness were her themes,</span>
<span class="i0">His generous plans, his patriotic schemes;</span>
<span class="i0">What he had done for some, a favourite few,</span>
<span class="i0">What for his favourites still he meant to do;</span>
<span class="i0">Not that he always listen’d&mdash;which was hard&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">To her, when speaking of her great regard <span class="linenum">320</span></span>
<span class="i0">For certain friends&mdash;‘but you, as I may say,</span>
<span class="i0">Are his own choice&mdash;I am not jealous&mdash;nay!’</span>
<span class="i2">“Then came the man himself, and came with speed,</span>
<span class="i0">As just from business of importance freed;</span>
<span class="i0">Or just escaping, came with looks of fire,</span>
<span class="i0">As if he’d just attain’d his full desire;</span>
<span class="i0">As if Prosperity and he for life</span>
<span class="i0">Were wed, and he was showing off his wife;</span>
<span class="i0">Pleased to display his influence, and to prove</span>
<span class="i0">Himself the object of her partial love; <span class="linenum">330</span></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps with this was join’d the latent fear,</span>
<span class="i0">The time would come when he should not be dear.</span>
<span class="i2">“Jane laugh’d at all their visits and parade,</span>
<span class="i0">And call’d it friendship in an hot-house made;</span>
<span class="i0">A style of friendship suited to his taste,</span>
<span class="i0">Brought on, and ripen’d, like his grapes, in haste;</span>
<span class="i0">She saw the wants that wealth in vain would hide,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And all the tricks and littleness of pride;</span>
<span class="i0">On all the wealth would creep the vulgar stain,</span>
<span class="i0">And grandeur strove to look itself in vain. <span class="linenum">340</span></span>
<span class="i2">“Lucy perceived&mdash;but she replied, ‘why heed</span>
<span class="i0">Such small defects?&mdash;they’re very kind indeed!’</span>
<span class="i0">And kind they were, and ready to produce</span>
<span class="i0">Their easy friendship, ever fit for use,</span>
<span class="i0">Friendship that enters into all affairs,</span>
<span class="i0">And daily wants, and daily gets, repairs.</span>
<span class="i2">“Hence at the cottage of the sisters stood</span>
<span class="i0">The Banker’s steed&mdash;he was so very good;</span>
<span class="i0">Oft through the roads, in weather foul or fair,</span>
<span class="i0">Their friend’s gay carriage bore the gentle pair; <span class="linenum">350</span></span>
<span class="i0">His grapes and nectarines woo’d the virgins’ hand;</span>
<span class="i0">His books and roses were at their command,</span>
<span class="i0">And costly flowers&mdash;he took upon him shame</span>
<span class="i0">That he could purchase what he could not name.</span>
<span class="i2">“Lucy was vex’d to have such favours shown,</span>
<span class="i0">And they returning nothing of their own;</span>
<span class="i0">Jane smiled, and begg’d her sister to believe,&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">‘We give at least as much as we receive.’</span>
<span class="i2">“Alas! and more; they gave their ears and eyes,</span>
<span class="i0">His splendor oft-times took them by surprise; <span class="linenum">360</span></span>
<span class="i0">And, if in Jane appear’d a meaning smile,</span>
<span class="i0">She gazed, admired, and paid respect the while;</span>
<span class="i0">Would she had rested there! Deluded maid,</span>
<span class="i0">She saw not yet the fatal price she paid;</span>
<span class="i0">Saw not that wealth, though join’d with folly, grew</span>
<span class="i0">In her regard; she smiled, but listened too;</span>
<span class="i0">Nay would be grateful, she would trust her all, &emsp;&nbsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">Her funded source&mdash;to him a matter small;<span class="ws6">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Taken for their sole use, and ever at their call,&emsp;&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">To be improved&mdash;he knew not how indeed, <span class="linenum">370</span></span>
<span class="i0">But he had methods&mdash;and they must succeed.</span>
<span class="i2">“This was so good, that Jane, in very pride,</span>
<span class="i0">To spare him trouble, for a while denied;</span>
<span class="i0">And Lucy’s prudence, though it was alarm’d,</span>
<span class="i0">Was by the splendor of the Banker charm’d;</span>
<span class="i0">What was her paltry thousand pounds to him,</span>
<span class="i0">Who would expend five thousand on a whim?</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And then the portion of his wife was known;</span>
<span class="i0">But not that she reserved it for her own.</span>
<span class="i2">“Lucy her lover trusted with the fact, <span class="linenum">380</span></span>
<span class="i0">And frankly ask’d, ‘if he approved the act?’</span>
<span class="i0">‘It promised well,’ he said; ‘he could not tell</span>
<span class="i0">How it might end, but sure it promised well;</span>
<span class="i0">He had himself a trifle in the Bank,</span>
<span class="i0">And should be sore uneasy if it sank.’</span>
<span class="i2">“Jane from her lover had no wish to hide</span>
<span class="i0">Her deed; but was withheld by maiden pride;</span>
<span class="i0">To talk so early&mdash;as if one were sure</span>
<span class="i0">Of being his; she could not that endure.</span>
<span class="i2">“But when the sisters were apart, and when <span class="linenum">390</span></span>
<span class="i0">They freely spoke of their affairs and men,</span>
<span class="i0">They thought with pleasure of the sum improved,</span>
<span class="i0">And so presented to the men they loved.</span>
<span class="i2">“Things now proceeded in a quiet train;</span>
<span class="i0">No cause appear’d to murmur or complain;</span>
<span class="i0">The monied man, his ever-smiling dame,</span>
<span class="i0">And their young darlings, in their carriage came.</span>
<span class="i0">Jane’s sprightly lover smiled their pomp to see,</span>
<span class="i0">And ate their grapes, with gratitude and glee;</span>
<span class="i0">But with the freedom there was nothing mean, <span class="linenum">400</span></span>
<span class="i0">Humble, or forward, in his freedom seen;</span>
<span class="i0">His was the frankness of a mind that shows</span>
<span class="i0">It knows itself, nor fears for what it knows.</span>
<span class="i0">But Lucy’s ever humble friend was awed</span>
<span class="i0">By the profusion he could not applaud;</span>
<span class="i0">He seem’d indeed reluctant to partake</span>
<span class="i0">Of the collation that he could not make;</span>
<span class="i0">And this was pleasant in the maiden’s view,&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Was modesty&mdash;was moderation too;</span>
<span class="i0">Though Jane esteem’d it meanness; and she saw <span class="linenum">410</span></span>
<span class="i0">Fear in that prudence, avarice in that awe.</span>
<span class="i2">“But both the lovers now to town are gone;</span>
<span class="i0">By business one is call’d, by duty one;</span>
<span class="i0">While rumour rises&mdash;whether false or true</span>
<span class="i0">The ladies knew not&mdash;it was known to few&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">But fear there was, and on their guardian-friend</span>
<span class="i0">They for advice and comfort would depend</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
<span class="i0">When rose the day; meantime from Belmont-place</span>
<span class="i0">Came vile report, predicting quick disgrace.</span>
<span class="i2">“’Twas told&mdash;the servants, who had met to thank <span class="linenum">420</span></span>
<span class="i0">Their lord for placing money in his Bank&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Their kind free master, who such wages gave,</span>
<span class="i0">And then increased whatever they could save&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">They who had heard they should their savings lose,</span>
<span class="i0">Were weeping, swearing, drinking at the news;</span>
<span class="i0">And still the more they drank, the more they wept,</span>
<span class="i0">And swore, and rail’d, and threatened, till they slept.</span>
<span class="i2">“The morning truth confirm’d the evening dread;</span>
<span class="i0">The Bank was broken, and the Banker fled;</span>
<span class="i0">But left a promise that his friends should have, <span class="linenum">430</span></span>
<span class="i0">To the last shilling&mdash;what his fortunes gave.</span>
<span class="i2">“The evil tidings reach’d the sister-pair,</span>
<span class="i0">And one like Sorrow look’d, and one Despair;</span>
<span class="i0">They from each other turn’d th’ afflicting look,</span>
<span class="i0">And loth and late the painful silence broke.</span>
<span class="i2">“‘The odious villain!’ Jane in wrath began;</span>
<span class="i0">In pity Lucy, ‘the unhappy man!</span>
<span class="i0">When time and reason our affliction heal,</span>
<span class="i0">How will the author of our sufferings feel?’</span>
<span class="i2">“‘And let him feel, my sister&mdash;let the woes <span class="linenum">440</span></span>
<span class="i0">That he creates be bane to his repose!</span>
<span class="i0">Let them be felt in his expiring hour,</span>
<span class="i0">When death brings all his dread, and sin its power:</span>
<span class="i0">Then let the busy foe of mortals state</span>
<span class="i0">The pangs he caused, his own to aggravate!</span>
<span class="i2">“‘Wretch! when our life was glad, our prospers gay,</span>
<span class="i0">With savage hand to sweep them all away!</span>
<span class="i0">And he must know it&mdash;know when he beguiled</span>
<span class="i0">His easy victims&mdash;how the villain smiled!</span>
<span class="i2">“‘Oh! my dear Lucy, could I see him crave <span class="linenum">450</span></span>
<span class="i0">The food denied, a beggar and a slave,</span>
<span class="i0">To stony hearts he should with tears apply,</span>
<span class="i0">And Pity’s self withhold the struggling sigh;</span>
<span class="i0">Or, if relenting weakness should extend</span>
<span class="i0">Th’ extorted scrap that justice would not lend,</span>
<span class="i0">Let it be poison’d by the curses deep</span>
<span class="i0">Of every wretch whom he compels to weep!’</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>
<span class="i2">“‘Nay, my sweet sister, if you thought such pain</span>
<span class="i0">Were his, your pity would awake again;</span>
<span class="i0">Your generous heart the wretch’s grief would feel, <span class="linenum">460</span></span>
<span class="i0">And you would soothe the pangs you could not heal.’</span>
<span class="i2">“‘Oh! never, never,&mdash;I would still contrive</span>
<span class="i0">To keep the slave whom I abhorr’d alive;</span>
<span class="i0">His tortured mind with horrid fears to fill,</span>
<span class="i0">Disturb his reason, and misguide his will;</span>
<span class="i0">Heap coals of fire, to lie like melted lead,</span>
<span class="i0">Heavy and hot, on his accursed head;</span>
<span class="i0">Not coals that mercy kindles hearts to melt,</span>
<span class="i0">But he should feel them hot as fires are felt,</span>
<span class="i0">Corroding ever, and through life the same, <span class="linenum">470</span></span>
<span class="i0">Strong self-contempt and ever-burning shame;</span>
<span class="i0">Let him so wretched live that he may fly</span>
<span class="i0">To desperate thoughts, and be resolved to die&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">And then let death such frightful visions give,</span>
<span class="i0">That he may dread th’ attempt, and beg to live!’</span>
<span class="i0">So spake th’ indignant maid, when Lucy sigh’d,</span>
<span class="i0">And, waiting softer times, no more replied.</span>
<span class="i2">“Barlow was then in town; and there he thought</span>
<span class="i0">Of bliss to come, and bargains to be bought;</span>
<span class="i0">And was returning homeward&mdash;when he found <span class="linenum">480</span></span>
<span class="i0">The Bank was broken, and his venture drown’d.</span>
<span class="i2">“‘Ah! foolish maid,’ he cried, ‘and what wilt thou</span>
<span class="i0">Say for thy friends and their excesses now?</span>
<span class="i0">All now is brought completely to an end;</span>
<span class="i0">What can the spendthrift now afford to spend?</span>
<span class="i0">Had my advice been&mdash;true, I gave consent,</span>
<span class="i0">The thing was purposed; what could I prevent?</span>
<span class="i2">“‘Who will her idle taste for flowers supply&mdash;&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">Who send her grapes and peaches? let her try;&mdash;&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">There’s none will give her, and she cannot buy.<span class="ws3">}</span><span class="linenum">490</span></span>
<span class="i2">“‘Yet would she not be grateful if she knew</span>
<span class="i0">What to my faith and generous love was due?</span>
<span class="i0">Daily to see the man who took her hand,</span>
<span class="i0">When she had not a sixpence at command;</span>
<span class="i0">Could I be sure that such a quiet mind</span>
<span class="i0">Would be for ever grateful, mild, and kind,</span>
<span class="i0">I might comply&mdash;but how will Bloomer act,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>
<span class="i0">‘When he becomes acquainted with the fact?</span>
<span class="i0">The loss to him is trifling&mdash;but the fall</span>
<span class="i0">From independence, that to her is all; <span class="linenum">500</span></span>
<span class="i0">Now, should he marry, ‘twill be shame to me</span>
<span class="i0">To hold myself from my engagement free;</span>
<span class="i0">And should he not, it will be double grace</span>
<span class="i0">To stand alone in such a trying case.</span>
<span class="i1">“‘Come then, my Lucy, to thy faithful heart</span>
<span class="i0">And humble love I will my views impart;</span>
<span class="i0">Will see the grateful tear that softly steals</span>
<span class="i0">Down the fair face and all thy joy reveals;</span>
<span class="i0">And when I say it is a blow severe,</span>
<span class="i0">Then will I add&mdash;restrain, my love, the tear, <span class="linenum">510</span></span>
<span class="i0">And take this heart, so faithful and so fond,</span>
<span class="i0">Still bound to thine; and fear not for that bond.’</span>
<span class="i2">“He said; and went, with purpose he believed</span>
<span class="i0">Of generous nature&mdash;so is man deceived.</span>
<span class="i2">“Lucy determined that her lover’s eye</span>
<span class="i0">Should not distress nor supplication spy;</span>
<span class="i0">That in her manner he should nothing find</span>
<span class="i0">To indicate the weakness of her mind.</span>
<span class="i0">He saw no eye that wept, no frame that shook;</span>
<span class="i0">No fond appeal was made by word or look; <span class="linenum">520</span></span>
<span class="i0">Kindness there was, but join’d with some restraint;</span>
<span class="i0">And traces of the late event were faint.</span>
<span class="i2">“He look’d for grief deploring, but perceives</span>
<span class="i0">No outward token that she longer grieves;</span>
<span class="i0">He had expected for his efforts praise,</span>
<span class="i0">For he resolved the drooping mind to raise;</span>
<span class="i0">She would, he judged, be humble, and afraid</span>
<span class="i0">That he might blame her rashness and upbraid;</span>
<span class="i0">And lo! he finds her in a quiet state,</span>
<span class="i0">Her spirit easy and her air sedate: <span class="linenum">530</span></span>
<span class="i0">As if her loss was not a cause for pain,</span>
<span class="i0">As if assured that he would make it gain,&mdash;</span>
<span class="i2">“Silent awhile, he told the morning news,</span>
<span class="i0">And what he judged they might expect to lose;</span>
<span class="i0">He thought himself, whatever some might boast,</span>
<span class="i0">The composition would be small at most,</span>
<span class="i0">Some shabby matter; she would see no more</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The tithe of what she held in hand before.</span>
<span class="i2">“How did her sister feel? and did she think</span>
<span class="i0">Bloomer was honest, and would never shrink? <span class="linenum">540</span></span>
<span class="i0">‘But why that smile; is loss like yours so light</span>
<span class="i0">That it can aught like merriment excite?</span>
<span class="i0">Well, he is rich, we know, and can afford</span>
<span class="i0">To please his fancy, and to keep his word;</span>
<span class="i0">To him ’tis nothing; had he now a fear,</span>
<span class="i0">He must the meanest of his sex appear;</span>
<span class="i0">But the true honour, as I judge the case,</span>
<span class="i0">Is both to feel the evil and embrace.’</span>
<span class="i2">“Here Barlow stopp’d, a little vex’d to see</span>
<span class="i0">No fear or hope, no dread or ecstasy. <span class="linenum">550</span></span>
<span class="i0">Calmly she spoke&mdash;‘Your prospects, sir, and mine</span>
<span class="i0">Are not the same&mdash;their union I decline;</span>
<span class="i0">Could I believe the hand for which you strove</span>
<span class="i0">Had yet its value, did you truly love,</span>
<span class="i0">I had with thanks addressed you, and replied,</span>
<span class="i0">Wait till your feelings and my own subside,</span>
<span class="i0">Watch your affections, and, if still they live,</span>
<span class="i0">What pride denies, my gratitude shall give.’</span>
<span class="i0">Ev’n then, in yielding, I had first believed</span>
<span class="i0">That I conferr’d the favour, not received. <span class="linenum">560</span></span>
<span class="i2">“‘You I release&mdash;nay, hear me&mdash;I impart</span>
<span class="i0">Joy to your soul&mdash;I judge not of your heart.</span>
<span class="i0">Think’st thou a being, to whom God has lent</span>
<span class="i0">A feeling mind, will have her bosom rent</span>
<span class="i0">By man’s reproaches? Sorrow will be thine,</span>
<span class="i0">For all thy pity prompts thee to resign!</span>
<span class="i0">Think’st thou that meekness’ self would condescend</span>
<span class="i0">To take the husband when she scorns the friend?</span>
<span class="i0">Forgive the frankness, and rejoice for life</span>
<span class="i0">Thou art not burden’d with so poor a wife. <span class="linenum">570</span></span>
<span class="i2">“‘Go! and be happy&mdash;tell, for the applause</span>
<span class="i0">Of hearts like thine, we parted, and the cause</span>
<span class="i0">Give, as it pleases.’ With a foolish look</span>
<span class="i0">That a dull school-boy fixes on his book</span>
<span class="i0">That he resigns, with mingled shame and joy,</span>
<span class="i0">So Barlow went, confounded like the boy.</span>
<span class="i2">“Jane, while she wept to think her sister’s pain</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Was thus increased, felt infinite disdain;</span>
<span class="i0">Bound as she was, and wedded by the ties</span>
<span class="i0">Of love and hope, that care and craft despise, <span class="linenum">580</span></span>
<span class="i0">She could but wonder that a man, whose taste</span>
<span class="i0">And zeal for money had a Jew disgraced,</span>
<span class="i0">Should love her sister; yet with this surprise,</span>
<span class="i0">She felt a little exultation rise;</span>
<span class="i0">Hers was a lover who had always held</span>
<span class="i0">This man as base, by generous scorn impell’d,</span>
<span class="i0">And yet, as one, of whom for Lucy’s sake</span>
<span class="i0">He would a civil distant notice take.</span>
<span class="i2">“Lucy, with sadden’d heart and temper mild,</span>
<span class="i0">Bow’d to correction, like an humbled child, <span class="linenum">590</span></span>
<span class="i0">Who feels the parent’s kindness, and who knows</span>
<span class="i0">Such the correction he who loves bestows.</span>
<span class="i2">“Attending always, but attending more</span>
<span class="i0">When sorrow ask’d his presence than before,</span>
<span class="i0">Tender and ardent, with the kindest air</span>
<span class="i0">Came Bloomer, fortune’s error to repair;</span>
<span class="i0">Words sweetly soothing spoke the happy youth,</span>
<span class="i0">With all the tender earnestness of truth.</span>
<span class="i2">“There was no doubt of his intention now&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">He will his purpose with his love avow; <span class="linenum">600</span></span>
<span class="i0">So judged the maid; yet, waiting, she admired</span>
<span class="i0">His still delaying what he most desired;</span>
<span class="i0">Till, from her spirit’s agitation free,</span>
<span class="i0">She might determine when the day should be.</span>
<span class="i0">With such facility the partial mind</span>
<span class="i0">Can the best motives for its favourites find.</span>
<span class="i2">“Of this he spake not, but he stayed beyond</span>
<span class="i0">His usual hour&mdash;attentive still and fond;&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">The hand yet firmer to the hand he prest,</span>
<span class="i0">And the eye rested where it loved to rest; <span class="linenum">610</span></span>
<span class="i0">Then took he certain freedoms, yet so small</span>
<span class="i0">That it was prudish so the things to call;</span>
<span class="i0">Things they were not&mdash;‘Describe’&mdash;that none can do,</span>
<span class="i0">They had been nothing had they not been new;</span>
<span class="i0">It was the manner and the look; a maid,</span>
<span class="i0">Afraid of such, is foolishly afraid;</span>
<span class="i0">For what could she explain? The piercing eye</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Of jealous fear could nought amiss descry.</span>
<span class="i1">“But some concern now rose; the youth would seek</span>
<span class="i0">Jane by herself, and then would nothing speak, <span class="linenum">610</span></span>
<span class="i0">Before not spoken; there was still delay,</span>
<span class="i0">Vexatious, wearying, wasting, day by day.</span>
<span class="i2">“‘He does not surely trifle!’ Heaven forbid!</span>
<span class="i0">She now should doubly scorn him if he did.</span>
<span class="i2">“Ah! more than this, unlucky girl! is thine;</span>
<span class="i0">Thou must the fondest views of life resign;</span>
<span class="i0">And in the very time resign them too,</span>
<span class="i0">When they were brightening on the eager view.</span>
<span class="i0">I will be brief,&mdash;nor have I heart to dwell</span>
<span class="i0">On crimes they almost share who paint them well. <span class="linenum">630</span></span>
<span class="i2">“There was a moment’s softness, and it seem’d</span>
<span class="i0">Discretion slept, or so the lover dream’d;</span>
<span class="i0">And, watching long the now confiding maid,</span>
<span class="i0">He thought her guardless, and grew less afraid;</span>
<span class="i0">Led to the theme that he had shunn’d before,</span>
<span class="i0">He used a language he must use no more&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">For if it answers, there is no more need,</span>
<span class="i0">And no more trial, should it not succeed.</span>
<span class="i2">“Then made he that attempt, in which to fail</span>
<span class="i0">Is shameful,&mdash;still more shameful to prevail. <span class="linenum">640</span></span>
<span class="i2">“Then was there lightning in that eye that shed</span>
<span class="i0">Its beams upon him&mdash;and his frenzy fled;</span>
<span class="i0">Abject and trembling at her feet he laid,</span>
<span class="i0">Despised and scorn’d by the indignant maid,</span>
<span class="i0">Whose spirits in their agitation rose,</span>
<span class="i0">Him, and her own weak pity, to oppose:</span>
<span class="i0">As liquid silver in the tube mounts high,</span>
<span class="i0">Then shakes and settles as the storm goes by.</span>
<span class="i2">“While yet the lover stay’d, the maid was strong,</span>
<span class="i0">But when he fled, she droop’d and felt the wrong&mdash; <span class="linenum">650</span></span>
<span class="i0">Felt the alarming chill, the enfeebled breath,</span>
<span class="i0">Closed the quick eye, and sank in transient death.</span>
<span class="i0">So Lucy found her; and then first that breast</span>
<span class="i0">Knew anger’s power, and own’d the stranger guest.</span>
<span class="i2">“‘And is this love? Ungenerous! Has he too</span>
<span class="i0">Been mean and abject? Is no being true?’</span>
<span class="i0">For Lucy judged that, like her prudent swain,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Bloomer had talk’d of what a man might gain;</span>
<span class="i0">She did not think a man on earth was found,</span>
<span class="i0">A wounded bosom, while it bleeds, to wound; <span class="linenum">660</span></span>
<span class="i0">Thought not that mortal could be so unjust,</span>
<span class="i0">As to deprive affliction of its trust;</span>
<span class="i0">Thought not a lover could the hope enjoy,</span>
<span class="i0">That must the peace he should promote destroy;</span>
<span class="i0">Thought not, in fact, that in the world were those,</span>
<span class="i0">Who to their tenderest friends are worse than foes,</span>
<span class="i0">Who win the heart, deprive it of its care,</span>
<span class="i0">Then plant remorse and desolation there.</span>
<span class="i2">“Ah! cruel he, who can that heart deprive</span>
<span class="i0">Of all that keeps its energy alive; <span class="linenum">670</span></span>
<span class="i0">Can see consign’d to shame the trusting fair,</span>
<span class="i0">And turn confiding fondness to despair;</span>
<span class="i0">To watch that time&mdash;a name is not assign’d</span>
<span class="i0">For crime so odious, nor shall learning find.</span>
<span class="i0">Now, from that day has Lucy laid aside</span>
<span class="i0">Her proper cares, to be her sister’s guide,</span>
<span class="i0">Guard, and protector. At their uncle’s farm</span>
<span class="i0">They past the period of their first alarm,</span>
<span class="i0">But soon retired, nor was he grieved to learn</span>
<span class="i0">They made their own affairs their own concern. <span class="linenum">680</span></span>
<span class="i2">“I knew not then their worth; and, had I known,</span>
<span class="i0">Could not the kindness of a friend have shown;</span>
<span class="i0">For men they dreaded; they a dwelling sought,</span>
<span class="i0">And there the children of the village taught;</span>
<span class="i0">There, firm and patient, Lucy still depends</span>
<span class="i0">Upon her efforts, not upon her friends;</span>
<span class="i0">She is with persevering strength endued,</span>
<span class="i0">And can be cheerful&mdash;for she will be good.</span>
<span class="i2">“Jane too will strive the daily tasks to share,</span>
<span class="i0">That so employment may contend with care; <span class="linenum">690</span></span>
<span class="i0">Not power, but will, she shows, and looks about<span class="ws7">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">On her small people, who come in and out;<span class="ws11">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And seems of what they need, or she can do, in doubt.&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i2">“There sits the chubby crew on seats around,</span>
<span class="i0">While she, all rueful at the sight and sound,</span>
<span class="i0">Shrinks from the free approaches of the tribe,</span>
<span class="i0">Whom she attempts, lamenting to describe;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>
<span class="i0">With stains the idlers gather’d in their way,<span class="ws12">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">The simple stains of mud, and mould, and clay, <span class="ws8">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And compound of the streets, of what we dare not say; &emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">With hair uncomb’d, grimed face, and piteous look, <span class="linenum">701</span></span>
<span class="i0">Each heavy student takes the odious book,</span>
<span class="i0">And on the lady casts a glance of fear,</span>
<span class="i0">Who draws the garment close as he comes near;</span>
<span class="i0">She then for Lucy’s mild forbearance tries,</span>
<span class="i0">And from her pupils turns her brilliant eyes,</span>
<span class="i0">Making new efforts, and with some success,</span>
<span class="i0">To pay attention while the students guess;</span>
<span class="i0">Who to the gentler mistress fain would glide,</span>
<span class="i0">And dread their station at the lady’s side. <span class="linenum">710</span></span>
<span class="i2">“Such is their fate;&mdash;there is a friendly few</span>
<span class="i0">Whom they receive, and there is chance for you;</span>
<span class="i0">Their school, and something gather’d from the wreck</span>
<span class="i0">Of that bad Bank, keeps poverty in check;</span>
<span class="i0">And true respect, and high regard, are theirs,</span>
<span class="i0">The children’s profit, and the [parents’] prayers.</span>
<span class="i2">“With Lucy rests the one peculiar care, <span class="ws16">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">That few must see, and none with her may share; <span class="ws10">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">More dear than hope can be, more sweet than pleasures are.&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">For her sad sister needs the care of love <span class="linenum">720</span></span>
<span class="i0">That will direct her, that will not reprove,</span>
<span class="i0">But waits to warn: for Jane will walk alone,</span>
<span class="i0">Will sing in low and melancholy tone;</span>
<span class="i0">Will read or write, or to her plants will run,</span>
<span class="i0">To shun her friends,&mdash;alas! her thoughts to shun.</span>
<span class="i2">“It is not love alone disturbs her rest,</span>
<span class="i0">But loss of all that ever hope possess’d:</span>
<span class="i0">Friends ever kind, life’s lively pleasures, ease,<span class="ws10">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">When her enjoyments could no longer please; <span class="ws10">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">These were her comforts then! she has no more of these.&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i2">“Wrapt in such thoughts, she feels her mind astray, <span class="linenum">731</span></span>
<span class="i0">But knows ’tis true that she has lost her way;</span>
<span class="i0">For Lucy’s smile will check the sudden flight,</span>
<span class="i0">And one kind look let in the wonted light.</span>
<span class="i2">“Fits of long silence she endures, then talks</span>
<span class="i0">Too much&mdash;with too much ardour, as she walks;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But still the shrubs that she admires dispense</span>
<span class="i0">Their balmy freshness to the hurried sense,</span>
<span class="i0">And she will watch their progress, and attend</span>
<span class="i0">Her flowering favourites as a guardian friend; <span class="linenum">740</span></span>
<span class="i0">To sun or shade she will her sweets remove,</span>
<span class="i0">‘And here,’ she says, ‘I may with safety love.’</span>
<span class="i2">“But there are hours when on that bosom steals</span>
<span class="i0">A rising terror&mdash;then indeed she feels&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Feels how she loved the promised good, and how</span>
<span class="i0">She feels the failure of the promise now.</span>
<span class="i2">“‘That other spoiler did as robbers do,</span>
<span class="i0">Made poor our state, but not disgraceful too,</span>
<span class="i0">This spoiler shames me, and I look within</span>
<span class="i0">To find some cause that drew him on to sin; <span class="linenum">750</span></span>
<span class="i0">He and the wretch who could thy worth forsake</span>
<span class="i0">Are the fork’d adder and the loathsome snake;</span>
<span class="i0">Thy snake could slip in villain-fear away,</span>
<span class="i0">But had no fang to fasten on his prey.</span>
<span class="i2">“‘Oh! my dear Lucy, I had thought to live</span>
<span class="i0">With all the comforts easy fortunes give;</span>
<span class="i0">A wife caressing, and caress’d&mdash;a friend,</span>
<span class="i0">Whom he would guide, advise, consult, defend,</span>

<span class="i0">Laughs at my loss&mdash;no trial for his truth,</span>
<span class="i0">It is a trifle he can not lament, <span class="linenum">770</span></span>
<span class="i0">A sum but equal to his annual rent;</span>
<span class="i0">And yet that loss, the cause of every ill,</span>

<span class="i0">Will short repose in verse and music find;</span>

<span class="i0">A more abstracted man within my view</span>

<span class="i2">“Yes&mdash;he was thoughtful&mdash;thinks the whole day long,</span>

<span class="i0">And therefore Finch was in a way to find</span>
<span class="i0">A good that much depended on his mind.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>
<span class="i2">“He look’d around, observing, till he saw</span>
<span class="i0">Augusta Dallas! when he felt an awe</span>
<span class="i0">Of so much beauty and commanding grace,</span>
<span class="i0">That well became the honours of her race.</span>
<span class="i2">“This lady never boasted of the trash</span>
<span class="i0">That commerce brings: she never spoke of cash; <span class="linenum">70</span></span>
<span class="i0">The gentle blood that ran in every vein</span>
<span class="i0">At all such notions blush’d in pure disdain.&mdash;</span>
<span class="i2">“Wealth once relinquished, there was all beside,</span>
<span class="i0">As Finch believed, that could adorn a bride;</span>
<span class="i0">He could not gaze upon the form and air,</span>
<span class="i0">Without concluding all was right and fair;</span>
<span class="i0">Her mild but dignified reserve supprest<span class="ws13">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">All free inquiry&mdash;but his mind could rest,<span class="ws11">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Assured that all was well, and in that view was blest.&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i2">“And now he asked, ’am I the happy man <span class="linenum">80</span></span>
<span class="i0">Who can deserve her? is there one who can?’</span>
<span class="i0">His mother told him, he possess’d the land</span>
<span class="i0">That puts a man in heart to ask a hand;</span>
<span class="i0">All who possess it feel they bear about</span>
<span class="i0">A spell that puts a speedy end to doubt;</span>
<span class="i0">But Finch was modest&mdash;‘May it then be thought <span class="ws10">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">That she can so be gained?’&mdash;‘She may be sought.&mdash;’<span class="ws6">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">‘Can love with land be won?’&mdash;‘By land is beauty bought.&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">Do not, dear Charles, with indignation glow,</span>
<span class="i0">All value that the want of which they know; <span class="linenum">90</span></span>
<span class="i0">Nor do I blame her; none that worth denies;</span>
<span class="i0">But can my son be sure of what he buys?</span>
<span class="i0">Beauty she has, but with it can you find</span>
<span class="i0">The inquiring spirit, or the studious mind?</span>
<span class="i0">This wilt thou need who art to thinking prone,</span>
<span class="i0">And minds unpair’d had better think alone;</span>
<span class="i0">Then how unhappy will the husband be,</span>
<span class="i0">Whose sole associate spoils his company?‘</span>
<span class="i0">This he would try; but all such trials prove</span>
<span class="i0">Too mighty for a man disposed to love; <span class="linenum">100</span></span>
<span class="i0">He whom the magic of a face enchains</span>
<span class="i0">But little knowledge of the mind obtains;</span>
<span class="i0">If by his tender heart the man is led,</span>
<span class="i0">He finds how erring is the soundest head.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>
<span class="i2">“The lady saw his purpose; she could meet</span>
<span class="i0">The man‘s inquiry, and his aim defeat;</span>
<span class="i0">She had a studied flattery in her look;</span>
<span class="i0">She could be seen retiring with a book;</span>
<span class="i0">She by attending to his speech could prove</span>
<span class="i0">That she for learning had a fervent love&mdash; <span class="linenum">110</span></span>
<span class="i0">Yet love alone, she modestly declared;</span>
<span class="i0">She must be spared inquiry, and was spared;</span>
<span class="i0">Of her poor studies she was not so weak</span>
<span class="i0">As in his presence, or at all, to speak;</span>
<span class="i0">But to discourse with him who, all agreed,</span>
<span class="i0">[Had] read so much, would be absurd indeed;</span>
<span class="i0">Ask what he might, she was so much a dunce</span>
<span class="i0">She would confess her ignorance at once.</span>
<span class="i2">“All this the man believed not&mdash;doom‘d to grieve</span>
<span class="i0">For this belief, he this would not believe: <span class="linenum">120</span></span>
<span class="i0">No! he was quite in raptures to discern</span>
<span class="i0">That love, and that avidity to learn.</span>
<span class="i0">‘Could she have found,’ she said, ‘a friend, a guide,</span>
<span class="i0">Like him, to study had been all her pride;</span>
<span class="i0">But, doom‘d so long to frivolous employ,</span>
<span class="i0">How could she those superior views enjoy?</span>
<span class="i0">The day might come&mdash;a happy day for her,</span>
<span class="i0">When she might choose the ways she should prefer.’</span>
<span class="i2">“Then too he learn‘d in accidental way,<span class="ws4">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">How much she grieved to lose the given day&emsp;}<span class="linenum">130</span></span>
<span class="i0">In dissipation wild, in visitation gay.<span class="ws8">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Happy, most happy, must the woman prove</span>
<span class="i0">Who proudly looks on him she vows to love;</span>
<span class="i0">Who can her humble acquisitions state,</span>
<span class="i0">That he will praise, at least will tolerate.</span>
<span class="i2">“Still the cool mother sundry doubts express’d,&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">‘How! is Augusta graver than the rest?</span>
<span class="i0">There are three others: they are not inclined</span>
<span class="i0">To feed with precious food the empty mind;</span>
<span class="i0">Whence this strong relish?’ ‘It is very strong,’ <span class="linenum">140</span></span>
<span class="i0">Replied the son, ‘and has possess’d her long;</span>
<span class="i0">Increased indeed, I may presume, by views&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">We may suppose&mdash;ah! may she not refuse?’</span>
<span class="i0">‘Fear not!&mdash;I see the question must be tried,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, is determined&mdash;let us to your bride.’</span>
<span class="i2">“They soon were wedded, and the nymph appear’d</span>
<span class="i0">By all her promised excellence endear’d:</span>
<span class="i0">Her words were kind, were cautious, and were few,</span>
<span class="i0">And she was proud&mdash;of what her husband knew.</span>
<span class="i2">“Weeks pass’d away, some five or six, before, <span class="linenum">150</span></span>
<span class="i0">Bless’d in the present, Finch could think of more.</span>
<span class="i0">A month was next upon a journey spent,</span>
<span class="i0">When to the Lakes the fond companions went;</span>
<span class="i0">Then the gay town received them, and, at last,</span>
<span class="i0">Home to their mansion, man and wife, they pass’d.</span>
<span class="i2">“And now in quiet way they came to live</span>
<span class="i0">On what their fortune, love, and hopes would give.</span>
<span class="i0">The honied moon had nought but silver rays,</span>
<span class="i0">And shone benignly on their early days;</span>
<span class="i0">The second moon a light less vivid shed, <span class="linenum">160</span></span>
<span class="i0">And now the silver rays were tinged with lead.</span>
<span class="i0">They now began to look beyond the Hall,</span>
<span class="i0">And think what friends would make a morning-call;</span>
<span class="i0">Their former appetites return’d, and now</span>
<span class="i0">Both could their wishes and their tastes avow;</span>
<span class="i0">’Twas now no longer ‘just what you approve,’</span>
<span class="i0">But ‘let the wild fowl be to-day, my love.’</span>
<span class="i0">In fact the senses, drawn aside by force</span>
<span class="i0">Of a strong passion, sought their usual course.</span>
<span class="i2">“Now to her music would the wife repair, <span class="linenum">170</span></span>
<span class="i0">To which he listen’d once with eager air;</span>
<span class="i0">When there was so much harmony within,</span>
<span class="i0">That any note was sure its way to win;</span>
<span class="i0">But now the sweet melodious tones were sent</span>
<span class="i0">From the struck chords, and none cared where they went.</span>
<span class="i0">Full well we know that many a favourite air</span>
<span class="i0">That charms a party fails to charm a pair;</span>
<span class="i0">And as Augusta play’d she look’d around,</span>
<span class="i0">To see if one was dying at the sound;</span>
<span class="i0">But all were gone&mdash;a husband, wrapt in gloom, <span class="linenum">180</span></span>
<span class="i0">Stalk’d careless, listless, up and down the room.</span>
<span class="i2">“And now ’tis time to fill that ductile mind</span>
<span class="i0">With knowledge, from his stores of various kind.</span>
<span class="i0">His mother, in a peevish mood, had ask’d,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>
<span class="i0">’Does your Augusta profit? is she task’d?’</span>
<span class="i2">“‘Madam!’ he cried, offended with her looks,</span>
<span class="i0">‘There’s time for all things, and not all for books:</span>
<span class="i0">Just on one’s marriage to sit down, and prate</span>
<span class="i0">On points of learning, is a thing I hate.&mdash;’</span>
<span class="i2">“‘’Tis right, my son, and it appears to me, <span class="linenum">190</span></span>
<span class="i0">If deep your hatred, you must well agree.’</span>
<span class="i2">“Finch was too angry for a man so wise,</span>
<span class="i0">And said, ‘Insinuation I despise!</span>
<span class="i0">Nor do I wish to have a mind so full</span>
<span class="i0">Of learned trash&mdash;it makes a woman dull:</span>
<span class="i0">Let it suffice, that I in her discern</span>
<span class="i0">An aptitude, and a desire to learn.&mdash;’</span>
<span class="i2">“The matron smiled, but she observed a frown</span>
<span class="i0">On her son’s brow, and calmly sat her down,</span>
<span class="i0">Leaving the truth to Time, who solves our doubt, <span class="linenum">200</span></span>
<span class="i0">By bringing his all-glorious daughter out&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Truth! for whose beauty all their love profess;</span>
<span class="i0">And yet how many think it ugliness!</span>
<span class="i2">“‘Augusta, love,’ said Finch, ‘while you engage</span>
<span class="i0">In that embroidery, let me read a page.</span>
<span class="i0">Suppose it Hume’s; indeed he takes a side,</span>
<span class="i0">But still an author need not be our guide;</span>
<span class="i0">And, as he writes with elegance and ease,</span>
<span class="i0">Do now attend&mdash;he will be sure to please.</span>
<span class="i0">Here at the Revolution we commence&mdash; <span class="linenum">210</span></span>
<span class="i0">We date, you know, our liberties from hence.’</span>
<span class="i2">“‘Yes, sure,’ Augusta answer’d with a smile;</span>
<span class="i0">‘Our teacher always talk’d about his style,</span>
<span class="i0">When we about the Revolution read,</span>
<span class="i0">And how the martyrs to the flames were led:</span>
<span class="i0">The good old bishops, I forget their names,</span>
<span class="i0">But they were all committed to the flames;</span>
<span class="i0">Maidens and widows, bachelors and wives&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">The very babes and sucklings lost their lives.</span>
<span class="i0">I read it all in Guthrie at the school&mdash; <span class="linenum">220</span></span>
<span class="i0">What now!&mdash;I know you took me for a fool;</span>
<span class="i0">There were five bishops taken from the stall,</span>
<span class="i0">And twenty widows, I remember all;</span>
<span class="i0">And by this token, that our teacher tried</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>
<span class="i0">’To cry for pity, till she howl’d and cried.’</span>
<span class="i2">“‘True, true, my love, but you mistake the thing&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">The Revolution that made William king</span>
<span class="i0">Is what I mean; the Reformation you,</span>
<span class="i0">In Edward and Elizabeth.’&mdash;‘’Tis true;</span>
<span class="i0">But the nice reading is the love between <span class="linenum">230</span></span>
<span class="i0">The brave Lord Essex and the cruel queen;</span>
<span class="i0">And how he sent the ring to save his head,</span>
<span class="i0">Which the false lady kept till he was dead.</span>
<span class="i2">“‘That is all true; now read, and I’ll attend;</span>
<span class="i0">But was not she a most deceitful friend?</span>
<span class="i0">It was a monstrous, vile, and treacherous thing</span>
<span class="i0">To show no pity, and to keep the ring;</span>
<span class="i0">But the queen shook her in her dying bed,</span>
<span class="i0">And ‘God forgive you!’ was the word she said;</span>
<span class="i0">‘Not I for certain;’&mdash;Come, I will attend; <span class="linenum">240</span></span>
<span class="i0">So read the Revolutions to an end.’</span>
<span class="i2">“Finch, with a timid, strange, inquiring look,</span>
<span class="i0">Softly and slowly laid aside the book</span>
<span class="i0">With sigh inaudible&mdash;&mdash;‘Come, never heed,’</span>
<span class="i0">Said he, recovering; ‘now I cannot read.’</span>
<span class="i2">“They walk’d at leisure through their wood and groves,</span>
<span class="i0">In fields and lanes, and talk’d of plants and loves,</span>
<span class="i0">And loves of plants.&mdash;Said Finch, ‘Augusta, dear,</span>
<span class="i0">You said you loved to learn,&mdash;were you sincere?</span>
<span class="i0">Do you remember that you told me once <span class="linenum">250</span></span>
<span class="i0">How much you grieved, and said you were a dunce?</span>
<span class="i0">That is, you wanted information. Say,</span>
<span class="i0">What would you learn? I will direct your way.’</span>
<span class="i2">“‘Goodness!’ said she, ‘what meanings you discern</span>
<span class="i0">In a few words! I said I wish’d to learn,</span>
<span class="i0">And so I think I did; and you replied,</span>
<span class="i0">The wish was good: what would you now beside?</span>
<span class="i0">Did not you say it show’d an ardent mind;</span>
<span class="i0">And pray what more do you expect to find?’</span>
<span class="i2">“‘My dear Augusta, could you wish indeed <span class="linenum">260</span></span>
<span class="i0">For any knowledge, and not then proceed?</span>
<span class="i0">That is not wishing&mdash;&mdash;’</span>
<span class="i24">“‘Mercy! how you tease!</span>
<span class="i0">You knew I said it with a view to please;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>
<span class="i0">A compliment to you, and quite enough&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">You would not kill me with that puzzling stuff!</span>
<span class="i0">Sure I might say I wish’d; but that is still</span>
<span class="i0">Far from a promise: it is not,&mdash;‘I will.’</span>
<span class="i2">“‘But come, to show you that I will not hide</span>
<span class="i0">My proper talents, you shall be my guide;</span>
<span class="i0">And lady Boothby, when we meet, shall cry, <span class="linenum">270</span></span>
<span class="i0">She’s quite as good a botanist as I.’</span>
<span class="i2">“‘Right, my Augusta;’ and, in manner grave,</span>
<span class="i0">Finch his first lecture on the science gave;</span>
<span class="i0">An introduction&mdash;and he said, ‘My dear,</span>
<span class="i0">Your thought was happy&mdash;let us persevere;</span>
<span class="i0">And let no trifling cause our work retard.’</span>
<span class="i0">Agreed the lady, but she fear’d it hard.</span>
<span class="i2">“Now o’er the grounds they rambled many a mile;</span>
<span class="i0">He show’d the flowers, the stamina, the style,</span>
<span class="i0">Calix and corol, pericarp and fruit, <span class="linenum">280</span></span>
<span class="i0">And all the plant produces, branch and root;</span>
<span class="i0">Of these he treated, every varying shape,</span>
<span class="i0">Till poor Augusta panted to escape.</span>
<span class="i0">He show’d the various foliage plants produce,</span>
<span class="i0">Lunate and lyrate, runcinate, retuse;</span>
<span class="i0">Long were the learned words, and urged with force,</span>
<span class="i0">Panduriform, pinnatifid, premorse,</span>
<span class="i0">Latent, and patent, papulous, and plane&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">‘Oh!’ said the pupil, ‘it will turn my brain.’</span>
<span class="i0">‘Fear not,’ he answer’d, and again, intent <span class="linenum">290</span></span>
<span class="i0">To fill that mind, o’er class and order went;</span>
<span class="i0">And stopping, ‘Now,’ said he, ‘my love, attend.’</span>
<span class="i0">‘I do,’ said she, ‘but when will be an end?’&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">‘When we have made some progress&mdash;now begin,</span>
<span class="i0">Which is the stigma, show me with the pin;</span>
<span class="i0">Come, I have told you, dearest, let me see,</span>
<span class="i0">Times very many&mdash;tell it now to me.’</span>
<span class="i2">“‘Stigma! I know,&mdash;the things with yellow heads,</span>
<span class="i0">That shed the dust, and grow upon the threads;</span>
<span class="i0">You call them wives and husbands, but you know <span class="linenum">300</span></span>
<span class="i0">That is a joke&mdash;here, look, and I will show</span>
<span class="i0">All I remember.’&mdash;Doleful was the look</span>
<span class="i0">Of the preceptor, when he shut his book&mdash;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The system brought to aid them in their view,</span>
<span class="i0">And now with sighs return’d&mdash;‘It will not do.’</span>
<span class="i2">“A handsome face first led him to suppose,</span>
<span class="i0">There must be talent with such looks as those;</span>
<span class="i0">The want of talent taught him now to find</span>
<span class="i0">The face less handsome with so poor a mind;</span>
<span class="i0">And half the beauty faded, when he found <span class="linenum">310</span></span>
<span class="i0">His cherish’d hopes were falling to the ground.</span>
<span class="i2">“Finch lost his spirit; but e’en then he sought</span>
<span class="i0">For fancied powers: she might in time be taught.</span>
<span class="i0">Sure there was nothing in that mind to fear;</span>
<span class="i0">The favourite study did not yet appear.&mdash;</span>
<span class="i2">“Once he express’d a doubt if she could look</span>
<span class="i0">For five succeeding minutes on a book;</span>
<span class="i0">When, with awaken’d spirit, she replied,</span>
<span class="i0">‘He was mistaken, and she would be tried.’</span>
<span class="i2">“With this delighted, he new hopes express’d&mdash; <span class="linenum">320</span></span>
<span class="i0">‘How do I know?&mdash;She may abide the test?</span>
<span class="i0">Men I have known, and famous in their day,</span>
<span class="i0">Who were by chance directed in their way.</span>
<span class="i0">I have been hasty.&mdash;Well, Augusta, well,</span>
<span class="i0">What is your favourite reading? prithee tell;</span>
<span class="i0">Our different tastes may different books require&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Yours I may not peruse, and yet admire:</span>
<span class="i0">Do then explain.’&mdash;‘Good Heaven!’ said she, in haste,</span>
<span class="i0">‘How do I hate these lectures upon taste!’</span>
<span class="i2">“‘I lecture not, my love; but do declare&mdash; <span class="linenum">330</span></span>
<span class="i0">You read, you say&mdash;what your attainments are.’</span>
<span class="i2">“‘Oh! you believe,’ said she, ‘that other things</span>
<span class="i0">Are read as well as histories of kings,</span>
<span class="i0">And loves of plants, with all that simple stuff</span>
<span class="i0">About their sex, of which I know enough.</span>
<span class="i0">Well, if I must, I will my studies name,</span>
<span class="i0">Blame if you please&mdash;I know you love to blame.</span>
<span class="i0">When all our childish books were set apart,</span>
<span class="i0">The first I read was ‘Wanderings of the Heart:’</span>
<span class="i0">It was a story, where was done a deed <span class="linenum">340</span></span>
<span class="i0">So dreadful, that alone I fear’d to read.</span>
<span class="i2">“‘The next was ‘The Confessions of a Nun&mdash;’</span>
<span class="i0">’Twas quite a shame such evil should be done;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>
<span class="i0">‘Nun of&mdash;no matter for the creature’s name,</span>
<span class="i0">For there are girls no nunnery can tame.</span>
<span class="i0">Then was the story of the Haunted Hall,</span>
<span class="i0">Where the huge picture nodded from the wall</span>
<span class="i0">When the old lord look’d up with trembling dread,</span>
<span class="i0">And I grew pale, and shudder’d as I read.</span>
<span class="i0">Then came the tales of Winters, Summers, Springs, <span class="linenum">350</span></span>
<span class="i0">At Bath and Brighton,&mdash;they were pretty things!</span>
<span class="i0">No ghosts nor spectres there were heard or seen,</span>
<span class="i0">But all was love and flight to Gretna-green.</span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps your greater learning may despise</span>
<span class="i0">What others like, and there your wisdom lies&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Well! do not frown&mdash;I read the tender tales</span>
<span class="i0">Of lonely cots, retreats in silent vales</span>
<span class="i0">For maids forsaken, and suspected wives,</span>
<span class="i0">Against whose peace some foe his plot contrives;</span>
<span class="i0">With all the hidden schemes that none can clear <span class="linenum">360</span></span>
<span class="i0">Till the last book, and then the ghosts appear.</span>
<span class="i2">“‘I read all plays that on the boards succeed,&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">And all the works that ladies ever read&mdash; <span class="ws6">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Shakspeare, and all the rest&mdash;I did, indeed,&mdash;<span class="ws3">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Ay! you may stare; but, sir, believe it true</span>
<span class="i0">That we can read and learn, as well as you.</span>
<span class="i2">“‘I would not boast,&mdash;but I could act a scene</span>
<span class="i0">In any play, before I was fifteen.</span>
<span class="i2">“‘Nor is this all; for many are the times</span>
<span class="i0">I read in Pope and Milton, prose and rhymes; <span class="linenum">370</span></span>
<span class="i0">They were our lessons, and, at ten years old,</span>
<span class="i0">I could repeat&mdash;&mdash;but now enough is told.</span>
<span class="i0">Sir, I can tell you I my mind applied<span class="ws10">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">To all my studies, and was not denied<span class="ws9">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Praise for my progress&mdash;&mdash;Are you satisfied?’&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i2">“‘Entirely, madam! else were I possess’d</span>
<span class="i0">By a strong spirit who could never rest.</span>
<span class="i0">Yes! yes, no more I question&mdash;here I close</span>
<span class="i0">The theme for ever&mdash;let us to repose.’”</span>

<span class="i0">Save their kind friend the rector, Richard yet</span>
<span class="i0">Had not a favourite of his brother met;</span>
<span class="i0">Now at the Hall that welcome guest appear’d,</span>
<span class="i0">By trust, by trials, and by time endear’d;</span>
<span class="i0">Of him the grateful ’squire his love profess’d,</span>
<span class="i0">And full regard&mdash;he was of friends the best;</span>
<span class="i0">“Yet not to him alone this good I owe,</span>
<span class="i0">This social pleasure that our friends bestow;</span>
<span class="i0">The sex that wrought in earlier life my woes,</span>
<span class="i0">With loss of time who murder’d my repose, <span class="linenum">10</span></span>
<span class="i0">They to my joys administer, nor vex</span>
<span class="i0">Me more; and now I venerate the sex;</span>
<span class="i0">And boast the friendship of a spinster kind,</span>
<span class="i0">Cheerful and pleasant, to her fate resign’d;</span>
<span class="i0">Then by her side my bachelor I place,</span>
<span class="i0">And hold them honours to the human race.</span>
<span class="i0">Yet these are they in tale and song display’d,</span>
<span class="i0">The peevish man, and the repining maid;</span>
<span class="i0">Creatures made up of misery and spite,</span>
<span class="i0">Who taste no pleasures, except those they blight; <span class="linenum">20</span></span>
<span class="i0">From whom th’ affrighten’d niece and nephew fly&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Fear’d while they live, and useless till they die.</span>
<span class="i2">“Not such these friends of mine; they never meant</span>
<span class="i0">That youth should so be lost, or life be spent.</span>
<span class="i0">They had warm passions, tender hopes, desires</span>
<span class="i0">That youth indulges, and that love inspires;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But fortune frown’d on their designs, displaced</span>
<span class="i0">The views of hope, and love’s gay dreams disgraced;</span>
<span class="i0">Took from the soul her sunny views, and spread</span>
<span class="i0">A cloud of dark but varying gloom instead. <span class="linenum">30</span></span>
<span class="i0">And shall we these with ridicule pursue,</span>
<span class="i0">Because they did not what they could not do?</span>
<span class="i0">If they their lot preferr’d, still why the jest</span>
<span class="i0">On those who took the way they judged the best?</span>
<span class="i0">But if they sought a change, and sought in vain,</span>
<span class="i0">’Tis worse than brutal to deride their pain&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">But you will see them; see the man I praise,</span>
<span class="i0">The kind protector in my troubled days,</span>
<span class="i0">Himself in trouble; you shall see him now,</span>
<span class="i0">And learn his worth! and my applause allow.” <span class="linenum">40</span></span>
<span class="i2">This friend appear’d, with talents form’d to please,</span>
<span class="i0">And with some looks of sprightliness and ease;</span>
<span class="i0">To him indeed the ills of life were known,</span>
<span class="i0">But misery had not made him all her own.</span>
<span class="i2">They spoke on various themes, and George design’d</span>
<span class="i0">To show his brother this, the favourite mind;</span>
<span class="i0">To lead the friend, by subjects he could choose, <span class="ws10">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">To paint himself, his life, and earlier views,<span class="ws14">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">What he was bless’d to hope, what he was doom’d to lose.&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i2">They spoke of marriage, and he understood <span class="linenum">50</span></span>
<span class="i0">Their call on him, and said, “It is not good</span>
<span class="i0">To be alone, although alone to be</span>
<span class="i0">Is freedom; so are men in deserts free;</span>
<span class="i0">Men who unyoked and unattended groan,</span>
<span class="i0">Condemn’d and grieved to walk their way alone.</span>
<span class="i0">Whatever ills a married pair betide,</span>
<span class="i0">Each feels a stay, a comfort, or a guide;</span>
<span class="i0">‘Not always comfort,’ will our wits reply.&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Wits are not judges, nor the cause shall try.</span>
<span class="i2">“Have I not seen, when grief his visits paid, <span class="linenum">60</span></span>
<span class="i0">That they were easier by communion made?</span>
<span class="i0">True, with the quiet times and days serene,</span>
<span class="i0">There have been flying clouds of care and spleen;</span>
<span class="i0">But is not man, the solitary, sick</span>
<span class="i0">Of his existence, sad and splenetic?</span>
<span class="i0">And who will help him, when such evils come,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>
<span class="i0">To bear the pressure or to clear the gloom?</span>
<span class="i2">“Do you not find, that joy within the breast</span>
<span class="i0">Of the unwedded man is soon suppress’d;</span>
<span class="i0">While, to the bosom of a wife convey’d, <span class="linenum">70</span></span>
<span class="i0">Increase is by participation made?&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">The lighted lamp that gives another light,</span>
<span class="i0">Say, is it by th’ imparted blaze less bright?</span>
<span class="i0">Are not both gainers when the heart’s distress</span>
<span class="i0">Is so divided that the pain is less?</span>
<span class="i0">And when the tear has stood in either eye,</span>
<span class="i0">Love’s sun shines out, and they are quickly dry.”</span>
<span class="i2">He ended here&mdash;but would he not confess,</span>
<span class="i0">How came these feelings on his mind to press?</span>
<span class="i0">He would! nor fear’d his weakness to display <span class="linenum">80</span></span>
<span class="i0">To men like them; their weakness too had they.</span>
<span class="i3">Bright shone the fire, wine sparkled, sordid care</span>
<span class="i0">Was banish’d far, at least appear’d not there;</span>
<span class="i0">A kind and social spirit each possess’d,</span>
<span class="i0">And thus began his tale the friendly guest.</span>

<span class="i2">“Near to my father’s mansion&mdash;but apart,</span>
<span class="i0">I must acknowledge, from my father’s heart&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Dwelt a keen sportsman, in a pleasant seat;</span>
<span class="i0">Nor met the neighbours as should neighbours meet.</span>
<span class="i0">To them revenge appear’d a kind of right, <span class="linenum">90</span></span>
<span class="i0">A lawful pleasure, an avow’d delight;</span>
<span class="i0">Their neighbours too blew up their passion’s fire,</span>
<span class="i0">And urged the anger of each rival-squire;</span>
<span class="i0">More still their waspish tempers to inflame,</span>
<span class="i0">A party-spirit, friend of anger, came.</span>
<span class="i0">Oft would my father cry, ‘that tory-knave,</span>
<span class="i0">That villain-placeman, would the land enslave.’</span>
<span class="i0">Not that his neighbour had indeed a place,</span>
<span class="i0">But would accept one&mdash;that was his disgrace;</span>
<span class="i0">Who, in his turn, was sure my father plann’d <span class="linenum">100</span></span>
<span class="i0">To revolutionize his native land.</span>
<span class="i0">He dared the most destructive things advance,</span>
<span class="i0">And even pray’d for liberty to France;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Had still good hope that Heaven would grant his prayer,</span>
<span class="i0">That he might see a revolution there.</span>
<span class="i0">At this the tory-squire was much perplex’d,</span>
<span class="i0">‘Freedom in France!&mdash;what will he utter next?</span>
<span class="i0">Sooner should I in Paris look to see</span>
<span class="i0">An English army sent their guard to be.’</span>
<span class="i2">“My poor mamma, who had her mind subdued <span class="linenum">110</span></span>
<span class="i0">By whig-control, and hated every feud,</span>
<span class="i0">Would have her neighbour met with mind serene;</span>
<span class="i0">But fiercer spirit fired the tory-queen.</span>
<span class="i0">My parents both had given her high disgust,</span>
<span class="i0">Which she resenting said, ‘Revenge is just;’</span>
<span class="i0">And till th’ offending parties chose to stoop,</span>
<span class="i0">She judged it right to keep resentment up;</span>
<span class="i0">Could she in friendship with a woman live</span>
<span class="i0">Who could the insult of a man forgive?</span>
<span class="i0">Did not her husband in a crowded room <span class="linenum">120</span></span>
<span class="i0">Once call her idiot, and the thing was dumb?</span>
<span class="i0">The man’s attack was brutal to be sure,</span>
<span class="i0">But she no less an idiot to endure.</span>
<span class="i2">“This lofty dame, with unrelenting soul,</span>
<span class="i0">Had a fair girl to govern and control;</span>
<span class="i0">The dear Maria!&mdash;whom, when first I met,&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Shame on this weakness! do I feel it yet?</span>
<span class="i2">“The parents’ anger, you will oft-times see,</span>
<span class="i0">Prepares the children’s minds for amity;</span>
<span class="i0">Youth will not enter into such debate, <span class="linenum">130</span></span>
<span class="i0">’Tis not in them to cherish groundless hate;</span>
<span class="i0">Nor can they feel men’s quarrels or their cares,</span>
<span class="i0">Of whig or tory, partridges or hares.</span>
<span class="i2">“Long ere we loved, this gentle girl and I</span>
<span class="i0">Gave to our parents’ discord many a sigh;</span>
<span class="i0">It was not ours&mdash;and, when the meeting came,</span>
<span class="i0">It pleased us much to find our thoughts the same;</span>
<span class="i0">But grief and trouble in our minds arose</span>
<span class="i0">From the fierce spirits we could not compose;</span>
<span class="i0">And much it vex’d us that the friends so dear <span class="linenum">140</span></span>
<span class="i0">To us should foes among themselves appear.</span>
<span class="i2">“Such was this maid, the angel of her race,</span>
<span class="i0">Whom I had loved in any time and place,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But in a time and place which chance assign’d,</span>
<span class="i0">When it was almost treason to be kind;</span>
<span class="i0">When we had vast impediments in view,</span>
<span class="i0">Then wonder not that love in terror grew</span>
<span class="i0">With double speed&mdash;we look’d, and strove to find</span>
<span class="i0">A kindred spirit in the hostile mind;</span>
<span class="i0">But is it hostile? there appears no sign <span class="linenum">150</span></span>
<span class="i0">In those dear looks of warfare&mdash;none have mine;</span>
<span class="i0">At length I whisper’d&mdash;‘Would that war might cease</span>
<span class="i0">Between our houses, and that all was peace!’</span>
<span class="i0">A sweet confusion on her features rose,</span>
<span class="i0">‘She could not bear to think of having foes,</span>
<span class="i0">When we might all as friends and neighbours live,</span>
<span class="i0">And for that blessing, O! what would she give!’&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">‘Then let us try and our endeavours blend,’</span>
<span class="i0">I said, ‘to bring these quarrels to an end.’</span>
<span class="i0">Thus, with one purpose in our hearts, we strove, <span class="linenum">160</span></span>
<span class="i0">And, if no more, increased our secret love:</span>
<span class="i0">Love that, with such impediments in view,</span>
<span class="i0">To meet the growing danger stronger grew;</span>
<span class="i0">And from that time each heart, resolved and sure,</span>
<span class="i0">Grew firm in hope, and patient to endure.</span>
<span class="i2">“To those who know this season of delight</span>
<span class="i0">I need not strive their feelings to excite;</span>
<span class="i0">To those who know not the delight or pain,</span>
<span class="i0">The best description would be lent in vain;</span>
<span class="i0">And to the grieving, who will no more find <span class="linenum">170</span></span>
<span class="i0">The bower of bliss, to paint it were unkind.</span>
<span class="i0">I pass it by, to tell that long we tried</span>
<span class="i0">To bring our fathers over to our side;</span>
<span class="i0">’Twas bootless on their wives our skill to try,</span>
<span class="i0">For one would not, and one in vain, comply.</span>
<span class="i2">“First I began my father’s heart to move,</span>
<span class="i0">By boldly saying ‘We are born to love;’</span>
<span class="i0">My father answer’d, with an air of ease,</span>
<span class="i0">‘Well! very well! be loving if you please!</span>
<span class="i0">Except a man insults us or offends, <span class="linenum">180</span></span>
<span class="i0">In my opinion we should all be friends.’</span>
<span class="i2">“This gain’d me nothing; little would accrue</span>
<span class="i0">From clearing points so useless though so true;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But with some pains I brought him to confess,</span>
<span class="i0">That to forgive our wrongs is to redress.</span>
<span class="i2">“‘It might be so,’ he answer’d, yet with doubt</span>
<span class="i0">That it might not; ‘but what is this about?’</span>
<span class="i0">I dared not speak directly, but I strove</span>
<span class="i0">To keep my subjects, harmony and love.</span>
<span class="i2">“Coolly my father look’d, and much enjoy’d <span class="linenum">190</span></span>
<span class="i0">The broken eloquence his eye destroy’d;</span>
<span class="i0">Yet less confused, and more resolved at last,</span>
<span class="i0">With bolder effort to my point I past;</span>
<span class="i0">And, fondly speaking of my peerless maid, <span class="ws12">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">I call’d her worth and beauty to my aid;<span class="ws15">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">‘Then make her mine!’ I said, and for his favour pray’d.&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i2">“My father’s look was one I seldom saw;</span>
<span class="i0">It gave no pleasure, nor created awe:</span>
<span class="i0">It was the kind of cool contemptuous smile</span>
<span class="i0">Of witty persons, overcharged with bile; <span class="linenum">200</span></span>
<span class="i0">At first he spoke not, nor at last to me&mdash;</span>
<span class="i2">“‘Well now, and what if such a thing could be?</span>
<span class="i0">What, if the boy should his addresses pay</span>
<span class="i0">To the tall girl, would that old tory say?</span>
<span class="i0">I have no hatred to the dog&mdash;but, still,</span>
<span class="i0">It was some pleasure when I used him ill;</span>
<span class="i0">This I must lose if we should brethren be,</span>
<span class="i0">Yet may be not, for brethren disagree;</span>
<span class="i0">The fool is right&mdash;there is no bar in life</span>
<span class="i0">Against their marriage&mdash;let her be his wife.&mdash; <span class="linenum">210</span></span>
<span class="i0">Well, sir, you hear me!’&mdash;Never man complied,</span>
<span class="i0">And left a beggar so dissatisfied;</span>
<span class="i0">Though all was granted, yet was grace refused;<span class="ws4">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">I felt as one indulged, and yet abused; <span class="ws11">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And yet, although provoked, I was not unamused.&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i2">“In a reply like this appear’d to meet</span>
<span class="i0">All that encourage hope, and that defeat;</span>
<span class="i0">Consent, though cool, had been for me enough,</span>
<span class="i0">But this consent had something of reproof;</span>
<span class="i0">I had prepared my answer to his rage, <span class="linenum">220</span></span>
<span class="i0">With his contempt I thought not to engage.</span>
<span class="i0">I, like a hero, would my castle storm,</span>
<span class="i0">And meet the giant in his proper form;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Then, conquering him, would set my princess free:</span>
<span class="i0">This would a trial and a triumph be&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">When lo! a sneering menial brings the keys,</span>
<span class="i0">And cries in scorn, ‘Come, enter, if you please;</span>
<span class="i0">You’ll find the lady sitting on her bed,</span>
<span class="i0">And ’tis expected that you woo and wed.’</span>
<span class="i2">“Yet not so easy was my conquest found; <span class="linenum">230</span></span>
<span class="i0">I met with trouble ere with triumph crown’d.</span>
<span class="i0">Triumph, alas!&mdash;My father little thought,</span>
<span class="i0">A king at home, how other minds are wrought;</span>
<span class="i0">True, his meek neighbour was a gentle squire,</span>
<span class="i0">And had a soul averse from wrath and ire;</span>
<span class="i0">He answer’d frankly, when to him I went,</span>
<span class="i0">‘I give you little, sir, in my consent.’</span>
<span class="i0">He and my mother were to us inclined,</span>
<span class="i0">The powerless party with the peaceful mind;</span>
<span class="i0">But that meek man was destined to obey <span class="linenum">240</span></span>
<span class="i0">A sovereign lady’s unremitted sway,</span>
<span class="i0">Who bore no partial, no divided rule;</span>
<span class="i0">All were obedient pupils in her school.</span>
<span class="i0">She had religious zeal, both strong and sour,</span>
<span class="i0">That gave an active sternness to her power;</span>
<span class="i0">But few could please her&mdash;she herself was one</span>
<span class="i0">By whom that deed was very seldom done.</span>
<span class="i0">With such a being, so disposed to feed</span>
<span class="i0">Contempt and scorn&mdash;how was I to succeed?</span>
<span class="i0">But love commanded, and I made my prayer <span class="linenum">250</span></span>
<span class="i0">To the stern lady, with an humble air,</span>
<span class="i0">Said all that lovers hope, all measures tried</span>
<span class="i0">That love suggested, and bow’d down to pride.</span>
<span class="i2">“Yes! I have now the tygress in my eye&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">When I had ceased and waited her reply,</span>
<span class="i0">A pause ensued; and then she slowly rose,</span>
<span class="i0">With bitter smile predictive of my woes,</span>
<span class="i0">A look she saw was plainly understood&mdash;&mdash;</span>
<span class="i2">“‘Admire my daughter! Sir, you’re very good.</span>
<span class="i0">The girl is decent, take her all in all&mdash;<span class="ws18">}</span><span class="linenum">260</span></span>
<span class="i0">Genteel, we hope&mdash;perhaps a thought too tall; <span class="ws11">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">A daughter’s portion hers&mdash;you’ll think her fortune small.&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps her uncles, in a cause so good,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Would do a little for their flesh and blood;</span>
<span class="i0">We are not ill allied&mdash;and, say we make</span>
<span class="i0">Her portion decent, whither would you take?</span>
<span class="i0">Is there some cottage on your father’s ground,</span>
<span class="i0">Where may a dwelling for the girl be found?</span>
<span class="i0">Or a small farm&mdash;your mother understands</span>
<span class="i0">How to make useful such a pair of hands. <span class="linenum">270</span></span>
<span class="i2">“‘But this we drop at present, if you please;</span>
<span class="i0">We shall have leisure for such things as these;</span>
<span class="i0">They will be proper ere you fix the day</span>
<span class="i0">For the poor girl to honour and obey;</span>
<span class="i0">At present therefore we may put an end</span>
<span class="i0">To our discourse&mdash;Good morrow to you, friend!’</span>
<span class="i2">“Then, with a solemn curtesy and profound,<span class="ws8">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Her laughing eye she lifted from the ground, <span class="ws9">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And left me lost in thought, and gazing idly round.&mdash; &emsp;}</span>
<span class="i2">“Still we had hope, and, growing bold in time, <span class="linenum">280</span></span>
<span class="i0">I would engage the father in our crime;</span>
<span class="i0">But he refused, for, though he wish’d us well,</span>
<span class="i0">He said, ‘he must not make his house a hell;’&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">And sure the meaning look that I convey’d</span>
<span class="i0">Did not inform him that the hell was made.</span>
<span class="i2">“Still hope existed that a mother’s heart</span>
<span class="i0">Would in a daughter’s feelings take a part;</span>
<span class="i0">Nor was it vain&mdash;for there is found access</span>
<span class="i0">To a hard heart, in time of its distress.</span>
<span class="i2">“The mother sicken’d, and the daughter sigh’d, <span class="linenum">290</span></span>
<span class="i0">And we petition’d till our queen complied;</span>
<span class="i0">She thought of dying, and, if power must cease,</span>
<span class="i0">Better to make, than cause, th’ expected peace;</span>
<span class="i0">And sure, this kindness mixing with the blood,</span>
<span class="i0">Its balmy influence caused the body’s good;</span>
<span class="i0">For as a charm it work’d upon the frame</span>
<span class="i0">Of the reviving and relenting dame;</span>
<span class="i0">For, when recover’d, she no more opposed</span>
<span class="i0">Her daughter’s wishes.&mdash;Here contention closed.</span>
<span class="i2">“Then bliss ensued, so exquisitely sweet, <span class="linenum">300</span></span>
<span class="i0">That with it once, once only, we can meet;</span>
<span class="i0">For, though we love again, and though once more</span>
<span class="i0">We feel th’ enlivening hope we felt before,</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Still the pure freshness of the joy that cast</span>
<span class="i0">Its sweet around us is for ever past.</span>
<span class="i0">O! time to memory precious&mdash;ever dear, <span class="ws14">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Though ever painful&mdash;this eventful year;<span class="ws14">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">What bliss is now in view! and now what woes appear! &emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">Sweet hours of expectation!&mdash;I was gone</span>
<span class="i0">To the vile town to press our business on; <span class="linenum">310</span></span>
<span class="i0">To urge its formal instruments&mdash;and lo!</span>
<span class="i0">Comes with dire looks a messenger of wo,</span>
<span class="i0">With tidings sad as death!&mdash;With all my speed</span>
<span class="i0">I reach’d her home!&mdash;but that pure soul was freed&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">She was no more&mdash;for ever shut that eye,</span>
<span class="i0">That look’d all soul, as if it could not die;</span>
<span class="i0">It could not see me&mdash;O! the strange distress<span class="ws4">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Of these new feelings!&mdash;misery’s excess,<span class="ws6">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">What can describe it? words will not express. &emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">When I look back upon that dreadful scene, <span class="linenum">320</span></span>
<span class="i0">I feel renew’d the anguish that has been,</span>
<span class="i0">And reason trembles&mdash;&mdash;Yes! you bid me cease,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor try to think; but I will think in peace.&mdash;</span>

<span class="i0">Of what she thought&mdash;she did not feel afraid. <span class="linenum">660</span></span>
<span class="i2">“I must confess, this creature in her mind</span>
<span class="i0">Nor face had beauty that a man would blind;</span>
<span class="i0">No poet of her matchless charms would write,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Yet sober praise they fairly would excite.</span>
<span class="i0">She was a creature form’d man’s heart to make</span>
<span class="i0">Serenely happy, not to pierce and shake;</span>
<span class="i0">If she were tried for breaking human hearts,</span>
<span class="i0">Men would acquit her&mdash;she had not the arts.</span>
<span class="i0">Yet without art, at first without design,</span>
<span class="i0">She soon became the arbitress of mine; <span class="linenum">670</span></span>
<span class="i0">Without pretensions&mdash;nay, without pretence,</span>
<span class="i0">But by a native strange intelligence</span>
<span class="i0">Women possess when they behold a man</span>
<span class="i0">Whom they can tease, and are assured they can;</span>
<span class="i0">Then ’tis their soul’s delight and pride to reign<span class="ws12">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">O’er the fond slave, to give him ease or pain,<span class="ws13">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And stretch and loose by turns the weighty viewless chain,&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i2">“Though much she knew, yet nothing could she prove;</span>
<span class="i0">I had not yet confess’d the crime of love;</span>
<span class="i0">But, in an hour when guardian-angels sleep, <span class="linenum">680</span></span>
<span class="i0">I fail’d the secret of my soul to keep;</span>
<span class="i0">And then I saw the triumph in those eyes</span>
<span class="i0">That spoke&mdash;‘Ay, now you are indeed my prize.’</span>
<span class="i0">I almost thought I saw compassion, too,</span>
<span class="i0">For all the cruel things she meant to do.</span>
<span class="i0">Well I can call to mind the managed air</span>
<span class="i0">That gave no comfort, that brought no despair,</span>
<span class="i0">That in a dubious balance held the mind,</span>
<span class="i0">To each side turning, never much inclined.</span>
<span class="i2">“She spoke with kindness&mdash;thought the honour high, <span class="linenum">690</span></span>
<span class="i0">And knew not how to give a fit reply;</span>
<span class="i0">She could not, would not, dared not, must not deem</span>
<span class="i0">Such language proof of ought but my esteem;</span>
<span class="i0">It made her proud&mdash;she never could forget</span>
<span class="i0">My partial thoughts&mdash;she felt her much in debt:</span>
<span class="i0">She who had never in her life indulged</span>
<span class="i0">The thought of hearing what I now divulged:</span>
<span class="i0">I, who had seen so many and so much&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">It was an honour&mdash;she would deem it such.</span>
<span class="i0">Our different years, indeed, would put an end<span class="ws8">}</span><span class="linenum">700</span></span>
<span class="i0">To other views, but still her father’s friend<span class="ws10">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">To her, she humbly hoped, would his regard extend. &emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">Thus, saying nothing, all she meant to say,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span>
<span class="i0">She play’d the part the sex delights to play;</span>
<span class="i0">Now by some act of kindness giving scope</span>
<span class="i0">To the new workings of excited hope,</span>
<span class="i0">Then by an air of something like disdain,</span>
<span class="i0">But scarcely seen, repelling it again;</span>
<span class="i0">Then for a season, neither cold nor kind,</span>
<span class="i0">She kept a sort of balance in the mind, <span class="linenum">710</span></span>
<span class="i0">And, as his pole a dancer on the rope,</span>
<span class="i0">The equal poise on both sides kept me up.</span>
<span class="i2">“Is it not strange that man can fairly view</span>
<span class="i0">Pursuit like this, and yet his point pursue;</span>
<span class="i0">While he the folly fairly will confess,</span>
<span class="i0">And even feel the danger of success?</span>
<span class="i0">But so it is, and nought the Circes care</span>
<span class="i0">How ill their victims with their poison fare,</span>
<span class="i0">When thus they trifle, and with quiet soul</span>
<span class="i0">Mix their ingredients in the maddening bowl: <span class="linenum">720</span></span>
<span class="i0">Their high regard, the softness of their air,</span>
<span class="i0">The pitying grief that saddens at a prayer,</span>
<span class="i0">Their grave petitions for the peace of mind</span>
<span class="i0">That they determine you shall never find,</span>
<span class="i0">And all their vain amazement that a man</span>
<span class="i0">Like you should love&mdash;they wonder how you can.</span>
<span class="i2">“For months the idler play’d her wicked part,</span>
<span class="i0">Then fairly gave the secret of her heart.</span>
<span class="i0">‘She hoped’&mdash;I now the smiling gipsy view&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">‘Her father’s friend would be her lover’s too; <span class="linenum">730</span></span>
<span class="i0">Young Henry Gale’&mdash;‘But why delay so long?’&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">‘She could not tell&mdash;she fear’d it might be wrong,</span>
<span class="i0">But I was good’&mdash;I knew not, I was weak,</span>
<span class="i0">And spoke as love directed me to speak.</span>
<span class="i2">“When in my arms their boy and girl I take,</span>
<span class="i0">I feel a fondness for the mother’s sake;</span>
<span class="i0">But though the dears some softening thoughts excite,</span>
<span class="i0">I have no wishes for the father’s right.</span>
<span class="i2">“Now all is quiet, and the mind sustains</span>
<span class="i0">Its proper comforts, its befitting pains; <span class="linenum">740</span></span>
<span class="i0">The heart reposes; it has had its share<span class="ws14">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Of love, as much as it could fairly bear;<span class="ws12">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And what is left in life that now demands its care?&emsp;}</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span>
<span class="i2">“For O! my friends, if this were all indeed;</span>
<span class="i0">Could we believe that nothing would succeed;</span>
<span class="i0">If all were but this daily dose of life,</span>
<span class="i0">Without a care or comfort, child or wife;</span>
<span class="i0">These walks for health with nothing more in view;</span>
<span class="i0">This doing nothing, and with labour too;</span>
<span class="i0">This frequent asking when ’tis time to dine; <span class="linenum">750</span></span>
<span class="i0">This daily dosing o’er the news and wine;</span>
<span class="i0">This age’s riddle, when each day appears</span>
<span class="i0">So very long, so very short the years;</span>
<span class="i0">If this were all&mdash;but let me not suppose&mdash; <span class="ws18">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">What then were life! whose virtues, trials, woes, <span class="ws13">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Would sleep th’ eternal sleep, and there the scene would close.&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i2">“This cannot be&mdash;but why has Time a pace</span>
<span class="i0">That seems unequal in our mortal race?</span>
<span class="i0">Quick is that pace in early life, but slow,</span>
<span class="i0">Tedious and heavy, as we older grow; <span class="linenum">760</span></span>
<span class="i0">But yet, though slow, the movements are alike,</span>
<span class="i0">And with no force upon the memory strike,</span>
<span class="i0">And therefore tedious as we find them all,</span>
<span class="i0">They leave us nothing we in view recal;</span>
<span class="i0">But days that we so dull and heavy knew</span>
<span class="i0">Are now as moments passing in review,</span>
<span class="i0">And hence arises ancient men’s report,</span>
<span class="i0">That days are tedious, and yet years are short.”</span>

<span class="i0">Three days remain’d their friend, and then again</span>
<span class="i0">The Brothers left themselves to entertain;</span>
<span class="i0">When spake the younger&mdash;“It would please me well</span>
<span class="i0">To hear thy spinster-friend her story tell;</span>
<span class="i0">And our attention would be nobly paid</span>
<span class="i0">Thus to compare the Bachelor and Maid.”</span>
<span class="i2">“Frank as she is,” replied the squire, “nor one</span>
<span class="i0">Is more disposed to show what she has done</span>
<span class="i0">With time, or time with her: yet all her care</span>
<span class="i0">And every trial she might not declare <span class="linenum">10</span></span>
<span class="i0">To one a stranger; but to me, her friend,</span>
<span class="i0">She has the story of those trials penn’d;</span>
<span class="i0">These shalt thou hear, for well the maid I know,</span>
<span class="i0">And will her efforts and her conquests show.</span>
<span class="i0">Jacques is abroad, and we alone shall dine,</span>
<span class="i0">And then to give this lady’s tale be mine;</span>
<span class="i0">Thou wilt attend to this good spinster’s life,</span>
<span class="i0">And grieve and wonder she is not a wife;</span>
<span class="i0">But if we judge by either words or looks,</span>
<span class="i0">Her mode of life, her morals, or her books, <span class="linenum">20</span></span>
<span class="i0">Her pure devotion, unaffected sense,</span>
<span class="i0">Her placid air, her mild benevolence,</span>
<span class="i0">Her gay good humour, and her manners free,</span>
<span class="i0">She is as happy as a maid can be;</span>
<span class="i0">If as a wife, I know not, and decline</span>
<span class="i0">Question like this, till I can judge of thine.”</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span>
<span class="i2">Then from a secret hoard drew forth the squire<span class="ws10">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">His tale, and said, “Attention I require&mdash;<span class="ws17">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">My verse you may condemn, my theme you must admire.” &emsp;}</span>

<span class="i2">I to your kindness speak, let that prevail, <span class="linenum">30</span></span>
<span class="i0">And of my frailty judge as beings frail.&mdash;&mdash;</span>
<span class="i2">My father, dying, to my mother left</span>
<span class="i0">An infant charge, of all things else bereft;</span>
<span class="i0">Poor, but experienced in the world, she knew</span>
<span class="i0">What others did, and judged what she could do;</span>
<span class="i0">Beauty she justly weigh’d, was never blind</span>
<span class="i0">To her own interest, and she read mankind:</span>
<span class="i0">She view’d my person with approving glance,</span>
<span class="i0">And judged the way my fortune to advance;</span>
<span class="i0">Taught me betimes that person to improve, <span class="linenum">40</span></span>
<span class="i0">And make a lawful merchandize of love;</span>
<span class="i0">Bade me my temper in subjection keep,</span>
<span class="i0">And not permit my vigilance to sleep;</span>
<span class="i0">I was not one, a miss, who might presume</span>
<span class="i0">Now to be crazed by mirth, now sunk in gloom;</span>
<span class="i0">Nor to be fretful, vapourish, or give way</span>
<span class="i0">To spleen and anger, as the wealthy may;</span>
<span class="i0">But I must please, and all I felt of pride,</span>
<span class="i0">Contempt, and hatred, I must cast aside.</span>
<span class="i2">“Have not one friend,” my mother cried, “not one; <span class="linenum">50</span></span>
<span class="i0">That bane of our romantic triflers shun;</span>
<span class="i0">Suppose her true, can she afford you aid?</span>
<span class="i0">Suppose her false, your purpose is betray’d;</span>
<span class="i0">And then in dubious points, and matters nice,</span>
<span class="i0">How can you profit by a child’s advice?</span>
<span class="i0">While you are writing on from post to post,</span>
<span class="i0">Your hour is over, and a man is lost;</span>
<span class="i0">Girls of their hearts are scribbling, their desires,</span>
<span class="i0">And what the folly of the heart requires,</span>
<span class="i0">Dupes to their dreams&mdash;but I the truth impart, <span class="linenum">60</span></span>
<span class="i0">You cannot, child, afford to have a heart.</span>
<span class="i0">Think nothing of it; to yourself be true,</span>
<span class="i0">And keep life’s first great business in your view&mdash;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Take it, dear Martha, for a useful rule,</span>
<span class="i0">She who is poor is ugly or a fool;</span>
<span class="i0">Or, worse than either, has a bosom fill’d</span>
<span class="i0">With soft emotions, and with raptures thrill’d.</span>
<span class="i2">“Read not too much, nor write in verse or prose,</span>
<span class="i0">For then you make the dull and foolish foes;</span>
<span class="i0">Yet those who do deride not nor condemn, <span class="linenum">70</span></span>
<span class="i0">It is not safe to raise up foes in them;</span>
<span class="i0">For though they harm you not, as blockheads do,</span>
<span class="i0">There is some malice in the scribbling crew.”</span>
<span class="i2">Such her advice; full hard with her had dealt</span>
<span class="i0">The world, and she the usage keenly felt.</span>
<span class="i2">“Keep your good name,” she said, “and that to keep</span>
<span class="i0">You must not suffer vigilance to sleep.</span>
<span class="i0">Some have, perhaps, the name of chaste retain’d,</span>
<span class="i0">When nought of chastity itself remain’d;</span>
<span class="i0">But there is danger&mdash;few have means to blind <span class="linenum">80</span></span>
<span class="i0">The keen-eyed world, and none to make it kind.</span>
<span class="i2">“And one thing more&mdash;to free yourself from foes</span>
<span class="i0">Never a secret to your friend disclose;</span>
<span class="i0">Secrets with girls, like loaded guns with boys,</span>
<span class="i0">Are never valued till they make a noise;</span>
<span class="i0">To show how trusted, they their power display;</span>
<span class="i0">To show how worthy, they the trust betray;</span>
<span class="i0">Like pence in children’s pockets secrets lie</span>
<span class="i0">In female bosoms&mdash;they must burn or fly.</span>
<span class="i2">“Let not your heart be soften’d; if it be, <span class="linenum">90</span></span>
<span class="i0">Let not the man his softening influence see;</span>
<span class="i0">For the most fond will sometimes tyrants prove,</span>
<span class="i0">And wound the bosom where they trace the love.</span>
<span class="i0">But to your fortune look, on that depend<span class="ws12">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">For your life’s comfort; comforts that attend<span class="ws9">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">On wealth alone&mdash;wealth gone, they have their end.”&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i2">Such were my mother’s cares to mend my lot,</span>
<span class="i0">And such her pupil they succeeded not.</span>
<span class="i2">It was conceived the person I had then</span>
<span class="i0">Might lead to serious thoughts some wealthy men, <span class="linenum">100</span></span>
<span class="i0">Who, having none their purpose to oppose,</span>
<span class="i0">Would soon be won their wishes to disclose.</span>
<span class="i0">My mother thought I was the very child</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span>
<span class="i0">By whom the old and amorous are beguiled:</span>
<span class="i0">So mildly gay, so ignorantly fair,</span>
<span class="i0">And pure, no doubt, as sleeping infants are;</span>
<span class="i0">Then I had lessons how to look and move,</span>
<span class="i0">And, I repeat, make merchandize of love.</span>
<span class="i2">Thrice it was tried if one so young could bring</span>
<span class="i0">Old wary men to buy the binding ring; <span class="linenum">110</span></span>
<span class="i0">And on the taper finger, to whose tip</span>
<span class="i0">The fond old swain would press his withering lip,</span>
<span class="i0">Place the strong charm:&mdash;and one would win my heart</span>
<span class="i0">By re-assuming youth&mdash;a trying part;</span>
<span class="i0">Girls, he supposed, all knew the young were bold,</span>
<span class="i0">And he would show that spirit in the old;</span>
<span class="i0">In boys they loved to hear the rattling tongue,</span>
<span class="i0">And he would talk as idly as the young;</span>
<span class="i0">He knew the vices our Lotharios boast,</span>
<span class="i0">And he would show of every vice the ghost, <span class="linenum">120</span></span>
<span class="i0">The evil’s self, without disguise or dress,</span>
<span class="i0">Vice in its own pure native ugliness:</span>
<span class="i0">Not, as the drunkenness of slaves, to prove</span>
<span class="i0">Vice hateful, but that seeing, I might love.</span>
<span class="i0">He drove me out, and I was pleased to see</span>
<span class="i0">Care of himself: it served as care for me;</span>
<span class="i0">For he would tell me, that he should not spare</span>
<span class="i0">Man, horse, or carriage, if I were not there:</span>
<span class="i0">Provoked at last, my malice I obey’d,</span>
<span class="i0">And smiling said, “Sir, I am not afraid.” <span class="linenum">130</span></span>
<span class="i2">This check’d his spirit; but he said, “Could you</span>
<span class="i0">Have charge so rich, you would be careful too.”</span>
<span class="i2">And he, indeed, so very slowly drove,</span>
<span class="i0">That we dismiss’d the over-cautious love.</span>
<span class="i2">My next admirer was of equal age, <span class="ws11">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And wish’d the child’s affection to engage, <span class="ws6">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And keep the fluttering bird a victim in his cage.&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">He had no portion of his rival’s glee,</span>
<span class="i0">But gravely praised the gravity in me;</span>
<span class="i0">Religious, moral, both in word and deed, <span class="linenum">140</span></span>
<span class="i0">But warmly disputatious in his creed;</span>
<span class="i0">Wild in his younger time, as we were told,</span>
<span class="i0">And therefore like a penitent when old.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Strange he should wish a lively girl to look</span>
<span class="i0">Upon the methods his repentance took!</span>
<span class="i2">Then he would say, he was no more a rake</span>
<span class="i0">To squander money for his passions’ sake;</span>
<span class="i0">Yet, upon proper terms, as man discreet,</span>
<span class="i0">He with my mother was disposed to treat,</span>
<span class="i0">To whom he told, “the price of beauty fell <span class="linenum">150</span></span>
<span class="i0">In every market, and but few could sell;</span>
<span class="i0">That trade in India, once alive and brisk,</span>
<span class="i0">Was over done, and scarcely worth the risk.”</span>
<span class="i0">Then stoop’d to speak of board, and what for life</span>
<span class="i0">A wife would cost&mdash;&mdash;if he should take a wife.</span>
<span class="i2">Hardly he bargain’d, and so much desired,</span>
<span class="i0">That we demurr’d; and he, displeased, retired.</span>
<span class="i2">And now I hoped to rest, nor act again</span>
<span class="i0">The paltry part for which I felt disdain,</span>
<span class="i0">When a third lover came within our view, <span class="linenum">160</span></span>
<span class="i0">And somewhat differing from the former two.</span>
<span class="i0">He had been much abroad, and he had seen</span>
<span class="i0">The world’s weak side, and read the hearts of men;</span>
<span class="i0">But all, it seem’d, this study could produce,</span>
<span class="i0">Was food for spleen, derision, and abuse;</span>
<span class="i0">He levell’d all, as one who had intent</span>
<span class="i0">To clear the vile and spot the innocent;</span>
<span class="i0">He praised my sense, and said I ought to be</span>
<span class="i0">From girl’s restraint and nursery maxims free;</span>
<span class="i0">He praised my mother; but he judged her wrong <span class="linenum">170</span></span>
<span class="i0">To keep us from th’ admiring world so long;</span>
<span class="i0">He praised himself; and then his vices named,</span>
<span class="i0">And call’d them follies, and was not ashamed.</span>
<span class="i0">He more than hinted that the lessons taught</span>
<span class="i0">By priests were all with superstition fraught;</span>
<span class="i0">And I must think them for the crowd design’d,</span>
<span class="i0">Not to alarm the free and liberal mind.</span>
<span class="i2">Wisdom with him was virtue. They were wrong</span>
<span class="i0">And weak, he said, who went not with the throng;</span>
<span class="i0">Man must his passions order and restrain <span class="linenum">180</span></span>
<span class="i0">In all that gives his fellow-subjects pain;</span>
<span class="i0">But yet of guilt he would in pity speak,</span>
<span class="i0">And as he judged, the wicked were the weak.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span>
<span class="i2">Such was the lover of a simple maid,</span>
<span class="i0">Who seem’d to call his logic to his aid,</span>
<span class="i0">And to mean something; I will not pretend</span>
<span class="i0">To judge the purpose of my reasoning friend,</span>
<span class="i0">Who was dismiss’d, in quiet to complain</span>
<span class="i0">That so much labour was bestow’d in vain.</span>
<span class="i2">And now my mother seem’d disposed to try <span class="linenum">190</span></span>
<span class="i0">A life of reason and tranquillity.</span>
<span class="i0">Ere this, her health and spirits were the best,</span>
<span class="i0">Hers the day’s trifling, and the nightly rest;</span>
<span class="i0">But something new was in her mind instill’d;</span>
<span class="i0">Unquiet thoughts the matron bosom fill’d;</span>
<span class="i0">For five and forty peaceful years she bore</span>
<span class="i0">Her placid looks, and dress becoming wore:</span>
<span class="i0">She could a compliment with pleasure take,</span>
<span class="i0">But no absurd impression could it make.</span>
<span class="i0">Now were her nerves disorder’d; she was weak, <span class="linenum">200</span></span>
<span class="i0">And must the help of a physician seek:</span>
<span class="i0">A Scotch physician, who had just began</span>
<span class="i0">To settle near us, quite a graceful man,</span>
<span class="i0">And very clever, with a soft address,</span>
<span class="i0">That would his meaning tenderly express.</span>
<span class="i2">Sick as my mother seem’d, when he inquired</span>
<span class="i0">If she was ill, he found her well attired;</span>
<span class="i0">She purchased wares so showy and so fine,</span>
<span class="i0">The venders all believed th’ indulgence mine;&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">But I, who thrice was woo’d, had lovers three, <span class="linenum">210</span></span>
<span class="i0">Must now again a very infant be;</span>
<span class="i0">While the good lady, twenty years a wife,</span>
<span class="i0">Was to decide the colour of his life:</span>
<span class="i0">And she decided. She was wont t’ appear</span>
<span class="i0">To these unequal marriages severe;</span>
<span class="i0">Her thoughts of such with energy she told,</span>
<span class="i0">And was repulsive, dignified, and cold;</span>
<span class="i0">But now, like monarchs weary of a throne,</span>
<span class="i0">She would no longer reign&mdash;at least alone.</span>
<span class="i2">She gave her pulse, and, with a manner sweet, <span class="linenum">220</span></span>
<span class="i0">Wish’d him to feel how kindly they could beat;</span>
<span class="i0">And ’tis a thing quite wonderful to tell</span>
<span class="i0">How soon he understood them, and how well.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span>
<span class="i2">Now, when she married, I from home was sent,</span>
<span class="i0">With grandmamma to keep perpetual Lent;</span>
<span class="i0">For she would take me on conditions cheap,</span>
<span class="i0">For what we scarcely could a parrot keep:</span>
<span class="i0">A trifle added to the daily fare</span>
<span class="i0">Would feed a maiden who must learn to spare.</span>
<span class="i2">With grandmamma I lived in perfect ease; <span class="linenum">230</span></span>
<span class="i0">Consent to starve, and I was sure to please.</span>
<span class="i0">Full well I knew the painful shifts we made<span class="ws10">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Expenses all to lessen or evade, <span class="ws19">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And tradesmen’s flinty hearts to soften and persuade.&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i2">Poor grandmamma among the gentry dwelt</span>
<span class="i0">Of a small town, and all the honour felt;</span>
<span class="i0">Shrinking from all approaches to disgrace</span>
<span class="i0">That might be mark’d in so genteel a place;</span>
<span class="i0">Where every daily deed, as soon as done,<span class="ws12">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Ran through the town as fast as it could run&mdash;<span class="ws8">}</span><span class="linenum">240</span></span>
<span class="i0">At dinners what appear’d&mdash;at cards who lost or won. &emsp;}</span>
<span class="i2">Our good appearance through the town was known,</span>
<span class="i0">Hunger and thirst were matters of our own;</span>
<span class="i0">And you would judge that she in scandal dealt</span>
<span class="i0">Who told on what we fed, or how we felt.</span>
<span class="i2">We had a little maid, some four feet high,</span>
<span class="i0">Who was employ’d our household stores to buy;</span>
<span class="i0">For she would weary every man in trade,</span>
<span class="i0">And tease t’ assent whom she could not persuade.</span>
<span class="i2">Methinks I see her, with her pigmy light, <span class="linenum">250</span></span>
<span class="i0">Precede her mistress in a moonless night;</span>
<span class="i0">From the small lantern throwing through the street</span>
<span class="i0">The dimm’d effulgence at her lady’s feet;</span>
<span class="i0">What time she went to prove her well-known skill</span>
<span class="i0">With rival friends at their beloved quadrille.</span>
<span class="i2">“And how’s your pain?” inquired the gentle maid,</span>
<span class="i0">For that was asking if with luck she play’d;</span>
<span class="i0">And this she answer’d as the cards decreed,</span>
<span class="i0">“O Biddy! ask not&mdash;very bad indeed;”</span>
<span class="i0">Or, in more cheerful tone, from spirit light, <span class="linenum">260</span></span>
<span class="i0">“Why, thank you, Biddy, pretty well to-night.”</span>
<span class="i2">The good old lady often thought me vain,</span>
<span class="i0">And of my dress would tenderly complain;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But liked my taste in food of every kind,</span>
<span class="i0">As from all grossness, like her own, refined.</span>
<span class="i0">Yet when she hinted that on herbs and bread</span>
<span class="i0">Girls of my age and spirit should be fed,</span>
<span class="i0">Whate’er my age had borne, my flesh and blood,</span>
<span class="i0">Spirit and strength, the interdict withstood;</span>
<span class="i0">But, though I might the frugal soul offend <span class="linenum">270</span></span>
<span class="i0">Of the good matron, now my only friend,</span>
<span class="i0">And though her purse suggested rules so strict,</span>
<span class="i0">Her love could not the punishment inflict;</span>
<span class="i0">She sometimes watch’d the morsel with a frown,</span>
<span class="i0">And sigh’d to see, but let it still go down.</span>
<span class="i2">Our butcher’s bill, to me a monstrous sum,</span>
<span class="i0">Was such that, summon’d, he forbore to come:</span>
<span class="i0">Proud man was he, and when the bill was paid,</span>
<span class="i0">He put the money in his bag and play’d,</span>
<span class="i0">Jerking it up, and catching it again, <span class="linenum">280</span></span>
<span class="i0">And poising in his hand in pure disdain;</span>
<span class="i0">While the good lady, awed by man so proud,</span>
<span class="i0">And yet disposed to have her claims allow’d,</span>
<span class="i0">Balanced between humility and pride,</span>
<span class="i0">Stood a fall’n empress at the butcher’s side,</span>
<span class="i0">Praising his meat as delicate and nice&mdash;&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“Yes, madam, yes! if people pay the price.”</span>
<span class="i2">So lived the lady, and so murmur’d I,</span>
<span class="i0">In all the grief of pride and poverty.</span>
<span class="i0">Twice in the year there came a note to tell <span class="linenum">290</span></span>
<span class="i0">How well mamma, who hoped the child was well;</span>
<span class="i0">It was not then a pleasure to be styled,</span>
<span class="i0">By a mamma of such experience, ‘Child!’</span>
<span class="i0">But I suppressed the feelings of my pride,</span>
<span class="i0">Or other feelings set them all aside.</span>
<span class="i2">There was a youth from college, just the one</span>
<span class="i0">I judged mamma would value as a son;</span>
<span class="i0">He was to me good, handsome, learn’d, genteel,</span>
<span class="i0">I cannot now what then I thought reveal;</span>
<span class="i0">But, in a word, he was the very youth <span class="linenum">300</span></span>
<span class="i0">Who told me what I judged the very truth,</span>
<span class="i0">That love like his and charms like mine agreed,</span>
<span class="i0">For all description they must both exceed.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Yet scarcely can I throw a smile on things</span>
<span class="i0">So painful, but that Time his comfort brings,</span>
<span class="i0">Or rather throws oblivion on the mind,</span>
<span class="i0">For we are more forgetful than resign’d.</span>
<span class="i2">We both were young, had heard of love and read,</span>
<span class="i0">And could see nothing in the thing to dread,</span>
<span class="i0">But like a simple pair our time employ’d <span class="linenum">310</span></span>
<span class="i0">In pleasant views to be in time enjoy’d.</span>
<span class="i0">When Frederick came, the kind old lady smiled</span>
<span class="i0">To see the youth so taken with her child;</span>
<span class="i0">A nice young man, who came with unsoil’d feet</span>
<span class="i0">In her best room, and neither drank nor eat.</span>
<span class="i0">Alas! he planted in a vacant breast</span>
<span class="i0">The hopes and fears that robb’d it of its rest.</span>
<span class="i2">All now appear’d so right, so fair, so just,</span>
<span class="i0">We surely might the lovely prospect trust;</span>
<span class="i0">Alas! poor Frederick and his charmer found <span class="linenum">320</span></span>
<span class="i0">That they were standing on fallacious ground:</span>
<span class="i0">All that the father of the youth could do</span>
<span class="i0">Was done&mdash;and now he must himself pursue</span>
<span class="i0">Success in life; and, honest truth to state,</span>
<span class="i0">He was not fitted for a candidate.</span>
<span class="i0">I, too, had nothing in this world below,</span>
<span class="i0">Save what a Scotch physician could bestow,</span>
<span class="i0">Who for a pittance took my mother’s hand;</span>
<span class="i0">And, if disposed, what had they to command?</span>
<span class="i2">But these were after fears, nor came t’ annoy <span class="linenum">330</span></span>
<span class="i0">The tender children in their dreams of joy;</span>
<span class="i0">Who talk’d of glebe and garden, tithe and rent,</span>
<span class="i0">And how a fancied income should be spent;</span>
<span class="i0">What friends, what social parties we should see,</span>
<span class="i0">And live with what genteel economy;</span>
<span class="i0">In fact, we gave our hearts as children give,</span>
<span class="i0">And thought of living as our neighbours live.</span>
<span class="i2">Now, when assured ourselves that all was well,</span>
<span class="i0">’Twas right our friends of these designs to tell;</span>
<span class="i0">For this we parted.&mdash;Grandmamma, amazed, <span class="linenum">340</span></span>
<span class="i0">Upon her child with fond compassion gazed;</span>
<span class="i0">Then pious tears appear’d, but not a word</span>
<span class="i0">In aid of weeping till she cried, “Good Lord!”</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span>
<span class="i0">She then, with hurried motion, sought the stairs,</span>
<span class="i0">And, calling Biddy, bade her come to prayers.</span>
<span class="i2">Yet the good lady early in her life</span>
<span class="i0">Was call’d to vow the duties of a wife;</span>
<span class="i0">She sought the altar by her friends’ advice,</span>
<span class="i0">No free-will offering, but a sacrifice;</span>
<span class="i0">But here a forward girl and eager boy <span class="linenum">350</span></span>
<span class="i0">Dared talk of life, and turn their heads with joy!</span>
<span class="i2">To my mamma I wrote in just the way</span>
<span class="i0">I felt, and said what dreaming lasses say:</span>
<span class="i0">How handsome Frederick was, by all confess’d,</span>
<span class="i0">How well he look’d, how very well he dress’d;</span>
<span class="i0">With learning much, that would for both provide,</span>
<span class="i0">His mother’s darling, and his father’s pride;</span>
<span class="i0">‘And then he loves me more than mind can guess,</span>
<span class="i0">Than heart conceive, or eloquence express.’</span>
<span class="i2">No letter came a doubtful mind to ease, <span class="linenum">360</span></span>
<span class="i0">And, what was worse, no Frederick came to please;</span>
<span class="i0">To college gone&mdash;so thought our little maid&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">But not to see me! I was much afraid;</span>
<span class="i0">I walk’d the garden round, and deeply sigh’d,</span>
<span class="i0">When grandmamma grew faint! and dropt, and died:</span>
<span class="i0">A fate so awful and so sudden drove</span>
<span class="i0">All else away, and half extinguish’d love.</span>
<span class="i2">Strange people came; they search’d the house around,</span>
<span class="i0">And, vulgar wretches! sold whate’er they found:</span>
<span class="i0">The secret hoards that in the drawers were kept, <span class="linenum">370</span></span>
<span class="i0">The silver toys that with the tokens slept,</span>
<span class="i0">The precious beads, the corals with their bells,</span>
<span class="i0">That laid secure, lock’d up in secret cells,</span>
<span class="i0">The costly silk, the tabby, the brocade,</span>
<span class="i0">The very garment for the wedding made,</span>
<span class="i0">Were brought to sale, with many a jest thereon!</span>
<span class="i0">“Going&mdash;a bridal dress&mdash;for&mdash;&mdash;Going!&mdash;Gone.”</span>
<span class="i0">That ring, dear pledge of early love and true,&emsp;&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">That to the wedded finger almost grew,<span class="ws8">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Was sold for six and ten-pence to a Jew!<span class="ws7">}</span><span class="linenum">380</span></span>
<span class="i2">Great was the fancied worth; but ah! how small</span>
<span class="i0">The sum thus made, and yet how valued all!</span>
<span class="i0">But all that to the shameful service went</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Just paid the bills, the burial, and the rent;</span>
<span class="i0">And I and Biddy, poor deserted maids!</span>
<span class="i0">Were turn’d adrift to seek for other aids.</span>
<span class="i2">Now left by all the world, as I believed,</span>
<span class="i0">I wonder’d much that I so little grieved;</span>
<span class="i0">Yet I was frighten’d at the painful view</span>
<span class="i0">Of shiftless want, and saw not what to do. <span class="linenum">390</span></span>
<span class="i0">In times like this the poor have little dread,</span>
<span class="i0">They can but work, and they shall then be fed;</span>
<span class="i0">And Biddy cheer’d me with such thoughts as this,</span>
<span class="i0">“You’ll find the poor have their enjoyments, Miss!”</span>
<span class="i0">Indeed I saw, for Biddy took me home</span>
<span class="i0">To a forsaken hovel’s cold and gloom;</span>
<span class="i0">And while my tears in plenteous flow were shed,</span>
<span class="i0">With her own hands she placed her proper bed,</span>
<span class="i0">Reserved for need. A fire was quickly made,</span>
<span class="i0">And food, the purchase for the day, display’d; <span class="linenum">400</span></span>
<span class="i0">She let in air to make the damps retire,</span>
<span class="i0">Then placed her sad companion at her fire;</span>
<span class="i0">She then began her wonted peace to feel,</span>
<span class="i0">She [brought] her wool, and sought her favourite wheel;</span>
<span class="i0">That as she turn’d, she sang with sober glee,</span>
<span class="i0">“Begone, dull Care! I’ll have no more with thee”;</span>
<span class="i0">Then turn’d to me, and bade me weep no more,</span>
<span class="i0">But try and taste the pleasures of the poor.</span>
<span class="i2">When dinner came, on table brown and bare</span>
<span class="i0">Were placed the humblest forms of earthen ware, <span class="linenum">410</span></span>
<span class="i0">With one blue dish, on which our food was placed,</span>
<span class="i0">For appetite provided, not for taste.</span>
<span class="i0">I look’d disgusted, having lately seen</span>
<span class="i0">All so minutely delicate and clean;</span>
<span class="i0">Yet, as I sate, I found to my surprise</span>
<span class="i0">A vulgar kind of inclination rise,</span>
<span class="i0">And near my humble friend, and nearer, drew,</span>
<span class="i0">Tried the strange food, and was partaker too.</span>
<span class="i2">I walk’d at eve, but not where I was seen,</span>
<span class="i0">And thought, with sorrow, what can Frederick mean? <span class="linenum">420</span></span>
<span class="i0">I must not write, I said, for I am poor;</span>
<span class="i0">And then I wept till I could weep no more.</span>
<span class="i2">Kind-hearted Biddy tried my griefs to heal,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span>
<span class="i0">This is a nothing to what others feel;</span>
<span class="i0">Life has a thousand sorrows worse than this,</span>
<span class="i0">A lover lost is not a fortune, Miss!</span>
<span class="i0">One goes, another comes, and which is best</span>
<span class="i0">There is no telling&mdash;set your heart at rest.”</span>
<span class="i2">At night we pray’d&mdash;I dare not say a word</span>
<span class="i0">Of our devotion, it was so absurd; <span class="linenum">430</span></span>
<span class="i0">And very pious upon Biddy’s part,</span>
<span class="i0">But mine were all effusions of the heart;</span>
<span class="i0">While she her angels call’d their peace to shed,</span>
<span class="i0">And bless the corners of our little bed.</span>
<span class="i0">All was a dream! I said, is this indeed<span class="ws13">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">To be my life? and thus to lodge and feed,<span class="ws9">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">To pay for what I have, and work for what I need? &emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">Must I be poor? and Frederick, if we meet,</span>
<span class="i0">Would not so much as know me in the street?</span>
<span class="i0">Or, as he walk’d with ladies, he would try <span class="linenum">440</span></span>
<span class="i0">To be engaged as we were passing by&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">And then I wept to think that I should grow</span>
<span class="i0">Like them whom he would be ashamed to know.</span>
<span class="i2">On the third day, while striving with my fate,</span>
<span class="i0">And hearing Biddy all its comforts state,</span>
<span class="i0">Talking of all her neighbours, all her schemes,</span>
<span class="i0">Her stories, merry jests, and warning dreams,</span>
<span class="i0">With tales of mirth and murder&mdash;O! the nights</span>
<span class="i0">Past, said the maiden, in such dear delights,</span>
<span class="i0">And I was thinking, can the time arrive <span class="linenum">450</span></span>
<span class="i0">When I shall thus be humbled, and survive?&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Then I beheld a horse and handsome gig,</span>
<span class="i0">With the good air, tall form, and comely wig</span>
<span class="i0">Of Doctor Mackey&mdash;I in fear began</span>
<span class="i0">To say, Good heaven, preserve me from the man!</span>
<span class="i0">But fears ill reason&mdash;heaven to such a mind</span>
<span class="i0">Had lent a heart compassionate and kind.</span>
<span class="i2">From him I learnt that one had call’d to know</span>
<span class="i0">What with my hand my parents could bestow;</span>
<span class="i0">And when he learn’d the truth, in high disdain <span class="linenum">460</span></span>
<span class="i0">He told my fate, and home return’d again.</span>
<span class="i2">“Nay, be not grieved, my lovely girl; but few</span>
<span class="i0">Wed the first love, however kind and true;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Something there comes to break the strongest vow,</span>
<span class="i0">Or mine had been my gentle Mattie now.</span>
<span class="i0">When the good lady died&mdash;but let me leave</span>
<span class="i0">All gloomy subjects&mdash;’tis not good to grieve.”</span>
<span class="i2">Thus the kind Scotchman soothed me; he sustain’d</span>
<span class="i0">A father’s part, and my submission gain’d,</span>
<span class="i0">Then my affection; and he often told <span class="linenum">470</span></span>
<span class="i0">My sterner parent that her heart was cold.</span>
<span class="i0">He grew in honour&mdash;he obtain’d a name&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">And now a favourite with the place became;</span>
<span class="i0">To me most gentle, he would condescend</span>
<span class="i0">To read and reason, be the guide and friend;</span>
<span class="i0">He taught me knowledge of the wholesome kind,</span>
<span class="i0">And fill’d with many a useful truth my mind.</span>
<span class="i0">Life’s common burden daily lighter grew;</span>
<span class="i0">And even Frederick lessen’d in my view.</span>
<span class="i0">Cold and repulsive as he once appear’d, <span class="linenum">480</span></span>
<span class="i0">He was by every generous act endear’d;</span>
<span class="i0">And, above all, that he with ardour fill’d</span>
<span class="i0">My soul for truth&mdash;a love by him instill’d;</span>
<span class="i0">Till my mamma grew jealous of a maid</span>
<span class="i0">To whom an husband such attention paid:</span>
<span class="i0">Not grossly jealous, but it gave her pain,</span>
<span class="i0">And she observed, “He made her daughter vain;</span>
<span class="i0">And what his help to one who must not look</span>
<span class="i0">To gain her bread by poring on a book?”</span>
<span class="i2">This was distress; but this, and all beside, <span class="linenum">490</span></span>
<span class="i0">Was lost in grief&mdash;my kinder parent died;</span>
<span class="i0">When praised and loved, when joy and health he gave,</span>
<span class="i0">He sank lamented to an early grave;</span>
<span class="i0">Then love and we the parent and the child,</span>
<span class="i0">Lost in one grief, allied and reconciled.</span>
<span class="i2">Yet soon a will, that left me half his worth,</span>
<span class="i0">To the same spirit gave a second birth;</span>
<span class="i0">But ’twas a mother’s spleen; and she indeed</span>
<span class="i0">Was sick, and sad, and had of comfort need.</span>
<span class="i0">I watch’d the way her anxious spirit took, <span class="linenum">500</span></span>
<span class="i0">And often found her musing o’er a book;</span>
<span class="i0">She changed her dress, her church, her priest, her prayer,</span>
<span class="i0">Join’d a new sect, and sought her comforts there.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Some strange, coarse people came, and were so free</span>
<span class="i0">In their addresses, they offended me;</span>
<span class="i0">But my mamma threw all her pride away&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">More humble she as more assuming they.</span>
<span class="i0">“And what,” they said, as having power, “are now</span>
<span class="i0">The inward conflicts? do you strive? and how?”</span>
<span class="i0">Themselves confessing thoughts so new and wild, <span class="linenum">510</span></span>
<span class="i0">I thought them like the visions of a child.</span>
<span class="i0">“Could we,” they ask, “our best good deeds condemn?&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">And did we long to touch the garment’s hem?<span class="ws9">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And was it so with us? for so it was with them.”<span class="ws7">}</span></span>
<span class="i2">A younger few assumed a softer part,</span>
<span class="i0">And tried to shake the fortress of my heart;</span>
<span class="i0">To this my pliant mother lent her aid,</span>
<span class="i0">And wish’d the winning of her erring maid.</span>
<span class="i0">I was constrain’d her female friends to hear;</span>
<span class="i0">But suffer’d not a bearded convert near; <span class="linenum">520</span></span>
<span class="i0">Though more than one attempted, with their whine.</span>
<span class="i0">And “Sister! sister! how that heart of thine?”</span>
<span class="i0">But this was freedom I for ever check’d:</span>
<span class="i0">Mine was a heart no brother could affect.</span>
<span class="i2">But, “would I hear the preacher, and receive</span>
<span class="i0">The dropping dew of his discourse at eve?</span>
<span class="i0">The soft, sweet words?” I gave two precious hours</span>
<span class="i0">To hear of gifts and graces, helps and powers;</span>
<span class="i0">When a pale youth, who should dismiss the flock,</span>
<span class="i0">Gave to my bosom an electric shock. <span class="linenum">530</span></span>
<span class="i0">While in that act, he look’d upon my face</span>
<span class="i0">As one in that all-equalizing place;</span>
<span class="i0">Nor, though he sought me, would he lay aside</span>
<span class="i0">Their cold, dead freedom, or their dull, sad pride.</span>
<span class="i2">Of his conversion he with triumph spoke,</span>
<span class="i0">Before he orders from a bishop took;</span>
<span class="i0">Then how his father’s anger he had braved,</span>
<span class="i0">And, safe himself, his erring neighbours saved.</span>
<span class="i0">Me he rejoiced a sister to behold</span>
<span class="i0">Among the members of his favourite fold; <span class="linenum">540</span></span>
<span class="i0">He had not sought me; the availing call</span>
<span class="i0">Demanded all his love, and had it all;</span>
<span class="i0">But, now thus met, it must be heaven’s design.&mdash;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Indeed! I thought; it never shall be mine!&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Yes, we must wed. He was not rich: and I</span>
<span class="i0">Had of the earthly good a mean supply;</span>
<span class="i0">But it sufficed. Of his conversion then</span>
<span class="i0">He told, and labours in converting men;</span>

<span class="i0">Another Daniel! honour’d, though so young. <span class="linenum">550</span></span>
<span class="i2">He call’d me sister; show’d me that he knew</span>

<span class="i0">My looks, I judge, express’d my full disdain; <span class="ws14">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">But it was given to the man in vain:<span class="ws22">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">They preach till they are proud, and pride disturbs the brain. &emsp;}</span>
<span class="i2">Is this the youth once timid, mild, polite?</span>
<span class="i0">How odious now, and sick’ning to the sight!</span>
<span class="i0">Proud that he sees, and yet so truly blind,</span>
<span class="i0">With all this blight and mildew on the mind!</span>
<span class="i2">Amazed, the solemn creature heard me vow <span class="linenum">560</span></span>
<span class="i0">That I was not disposed to take him now.</span>
<span class="i2">“Then, art thou changed, fair maiden? changed thy heart?”</span>
<span class="i0">I answered, “No; but I perceive thou art.”</span>
<span class="i2">Still was my mother sad, her nerves relax’d,</span>
<span class="i0">And our small income for advice was tax’d;</span>
<span class="i0">When I, who long’d for change and freedom, cried,</span>
<span class="i0">‘Let sea and Sidmouth’s balmy air be tried.’</span>
<span class="i0">And so they were, and every neighbouring scene,</span>
<span class="i0">That make the bosom, like the clime, serene;</span>
<span class="i0">Yet were her teachers loth to yield assent; <span class="linenum">570</span></span>
<span class="i0">And not without the warning voice we went;</span>
<span class="i0">And there was secret counsel all unknown</span>
<span class="i0">To me&mdash;but I had counsel of my own.</span>
<span class="i2">And now there pass’d a portion of my time</span>
<span class="i0">In ease delicious, and in joy sublime&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">With friends endear’d by kindness&mdash;with delight</span>
<span class="i0">In all that could the feeling mind excite,</span>

<span class="i0">Where we could pleasure find and beauty trace,</span>
<span class="i0">Or views at night, where on the rocky steep <span class="linenum">580</span></span>
<span class="i0">Shines the full moon, or glitters on the deep.</span>
<span class="i2">Yes, they were happy days; but they are fled!</span>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Still it is pleasure, though ’tis mix’d with pain,</span>
<span class="i0">To think of joys that cannot live again&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Here cannot live; but they excite desire</span>
<span class="i0">Of purer kind, and heavenly thoughts inspire!</span>
<span class="i2">And now my mother, weaken’d in her mind,</span>
<span class="i0">Her will, subdued before, to me resign’d.</span>
<span class="i0">Wean’d from her late directors, by degrees <span class="linenum">590</span></span>
<span class="i0">She sank resign’d, and only sought for ease.</span>

<span class="i0">My years&mdash;but other mode will I pursue,</span>

<span class="i0">Was I convinced th’ enthusiastic man</span>
<span class="i0">Had ruin’d what the loving boy began?</span>
<span class="i2">I answer doubting&mdash;I could still detect <span class="linenum">600</span></span>
<span class="i0">Feelings too soft&mdash;yet him I could reject:</span>
<span class="i0">Feelings that came when I had least employ&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">When common pleasures I could least enjoy&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">When I was pacing lonely in the rays</span>
<span class="i0">Of a full moon, in lonely walks and ways&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">When I was sighing o’er a tale’s distress,</span>
<span class="i0">And paid attention to my Bible less.</span>
<span class="i2">These found, I sought my remedies for these;</span>
<span class="i0">I suffer’d common things my mind to please,</span>
<span class="i0">And common pleasures; seldom walk’d alone, <span class="linenum">610</span></span>
<span class="i0">Nor when the moon upon the waters shone;</span>
<span class="i0">But then my candles lit, my window closed,</span>
<span class="i0">My needle took, and with my neighbours prosed;</span>
<span class="i0">And in one year&mdash;nay, ere the end of one,</span>
<span class="i0">My labour ended, and my love was done.</span>
<span class="i0">My heart at rest, I boldly look’d within,</span>

<span class="i0">Alas! with pride it answer’d, “Look around,</span>
<span class="i0">And tell me where a better heart is found.”</span>
<span class="i0">And then I traced my virtues; O! how few, <span class="linenum">620</span></span>
<span class="i0">In fact, they were, and yet how vain I grew;</span>
<span class="i0">Thought of my kindness, condescension, ease,</span>
<span class="i0">My will, my wishes, nay, my power to please;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span>
<span class="i0">I judged me prudent, rational, discreet,</span>
<span class="i0">And void of folly, falsehood and deceit;</span>
<span class="i0">I read, not lightly, as I some had known,</span>
<span class="i0">But made an author’s meaning all my own;</span>
<span class="i0">In short, what lady could a poet choose</span>
<span class="i0">As a superior subject for his muse?</span>
<span class="i2">So said my heart; and Conscience straight replied&mdash;&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">“I say the matter is not fairly tried:<span class="ws18">}</span><span class="linenum">631</span></span>
<span class="i0">I am offended, hurt, dissatisfied.<span class="ws20">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">First of the Christian graces, let me see</span>

<span class="i2">Thus Conscience; and she then a picture drew,</span>

<span class="i0">One I beheld&mdash;a wife, a mother&mdash;go</span>
<span class="i0">To gloomy scenes of wickedness and wo;</span>
<span class="i0">She sought her way through all things vile and base,</span>

<span class="i0">Fighting her way&mdash;the way that angels fight</span>
<span class="i0">With powers of darkness&mdash;to let in the light.</span>
<span class="i0">Tell me, my heart, hast thou such victory won</span>
<span class="i0">As this, a sinner of thy sex, has done, <span class="linenum">650</span></span>
<span class="i0">And calls herself a sinner? What art thou?</span>
<span class="i0">And where thy praise and exaltation now?</span>
<span class="i0">Yet is she tender, delicate, and nice,</span>

<span class="i0">Shrinks from the ruffian gaze, the savage gloom,</span>
<span class="i0">That reign where guilt and misery find an home&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Guilt chain’d, and misery purchased; and with them</span>
<span class="i0">All we abhor, abominate, condemn&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">The look of scorn, the scowl, th’ insulting leer</span>
<span class="i0">Of shame, all fix’d on her who ventures here. <span class="linenum">660</span></span>
<span class="i0">Yet all she braved! she kept her stedfast eye</span>
<span class="i0">On the dear cause, and brush’d the baseness by.</span>
<span class="i0">So would a mother press her darling child</span>

<span class="i0">Close to her breast, with tainted rags defiled.</span>
<span class="i2">But thou hast talents truly! say, the ten:</span>
<span class="i0">Come, let us look at their improvement then.</span>
<span class="i0">What hast thou done to aid thy suffering kind,</span>

<span class="i0">Hast thou not spent thy intellectual force</span>
<span class="i0">On books abstruse, in critical discourse? <span class="linenum">670</span></span>
<span class="i0">Wasting in useless energy thy days,</span>
<span class="i0">And idly listening to their common praise,</span>
<span class="i0">Who can a kind of transient fame dispense,</span>
<span class="i0">And say&mdash;“a woman of exceeding sense.”</span>
<span class="i2">Thus tried, and failing, the suggestions fled,</span>
<span class="i0">And a corrected spirit reign’d instead.</span>
<span class="i2">My mother yet was living; but the flame</span>
<span class="i0">Of life now flash’d, and fainter then became;</span>
<span class="i0">I made it pleasant, and was pleased to see</span>
<span class="i0">A parent looking as a child to me. <span class="linenum">680</span></span>
<span class="i2">And now our humble place grew wond’rous gay;<span class="ws5">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Came gallant persons in their red array: <span class="ws14">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">All strangers welcome there, extremely welcome they. &emsp;}</span>
<span class="i2">When in the church I saw inquiring eyes</span>
<span class="i0">Fix’d on my face with pleasure and surprise;</span>
<span class="i0">And soon a knocking at my door was heard;</span>
<span class="i0">And soon the lover of my youth appear’d&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Frederick, in all his glory, glad to meet,</span>
<span class="i0">And say, “his happiness was now complete.”</span>
<span class="i2">He told his flight from superstitious zeal; <span class="linenum">690</span></span>
<span class="i0">But first what torments he was doom’d to feel:</span>
<span class="i0">The tender tears he saw from women fall&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">The strong persuasions of the brethren all&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">The threats of crazed enthusiasts, bound to keep</span>
<span class="i0">The struggling mind, and awe the straying sheep&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">From these, their love, their curses, and their creed,</span>
<span class="i0">Was I by reason and exertion freed.</span>
<span class="i2">Then, like a man who often had been told</span>
<span class="i0">And was convinced success attends the bold,</span>
<span class="i0">His former purpose he renew’d, and swore <span class="linenum">700</span></span>
<span class="i0">He never loved me half so well before:</span>
<span class="i0">Before he felt a something to divide</span>
<span class="i0">The heart, that now had not a love beside.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</a></span>
<span class="i2">In earlier times had I myself amused,</span>
<span class="i0">And first my swain perplex’d, and then refused&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Cure for conceit; but now in purpose grave,</span>
<span class="i0">Strong and decisive the reply I gave.</span>
<span class="i0">Still he would come, and talk as idlers do,</span>
<span class="i0">Both of his old associates and his new;</span>
<span class="i0">Those who their dreams and reveries receive <span class="linenum">710</span></span>
<span class="i0">For facts, and those who would not facts believe.</span>
<span class="i2">He now conceived that truth was hidden, placed</span>
<span class="i0">He knew not where, she never could be traced;</span>
<span class="i0">But that in every place, the world around,</span>
<span class="i0">Might some resemblance of the nymph be found.</span>
<span class="i0">Yet wise men knew these shadows to be vain,</span>
<span class="i0">Such as our true philosophers disdain&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“They laugh to see what vulgar minds pursue&mdash; <span class="ws7">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Truth, as a mistress, never in their view&mdash;<span class="ws12">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">But there the shadow flies, and that, they cry, is true.” &emsp;}</span>
<span class="i2">Thus, at the college and the meeting train’d, <span class="linenum">721</span></span>
<span class="i0">My lover seem’d his acmè to have gain’d;</span>
<span class="i0">With some compassion I essay’d a cure:</span>
<span class="i0">“If truth be hidden, why art thou so sure?”</span>
<span class="i0">This he mistook for tenderness, and cried,</span>
<span class="i0">“If sure of thee, I care not what beside!”</span>
<span class="i0">Compelled to silence, I, in pure disdain,</span>
<span class="i0">Withdrew from one so insolent and vain;</span>
<span class="i0">He then retired; and, I was kindly told,</span>
<span class="i0">In pure compassion grew estranged and cold. <span class="linenum">730</span></span>
<span class="i2">My mother died; but, in my grief, drew near</span>
<span class="i0">A bosom friend, who dried the useless tear;</span>
<span class="i0">We lived together: we combined our shares</span>
<span class="i0">Of the world’s good, and learn’d to brave its cares.</span>
<span class="i0">We were the ladies of the place, and found</span>
<span class="i0">Protection and respect the country round;</span>
<span class="i0">We gave, and largely, for we wish’d to live</span>
<span class="i0">In good repute&mdash;for this ’tis good to give;</span>
<span class="i0">Our annual present to the priest convey’d</span>
<span class="i0">Was kindly taken&mdash;we in comfort pray’d. <span class="linenum">740</span></span>
<span class="i0">There none molested in the crimson pew</span>
<span class="i0">The worthy ladies, whom the vicar knew;</span>
<span class="i0">And we began to think that life might be&mdash;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Not happy all, but innocently free.</span>
<span class="i2">My friend in early life was bound to one</span>
<span class="i0">Of gentle kindred, but a younger son.</span>
<span class="i0">He fortune’s smile with perseverance woo’d,</span>
<span class="i0">And wealth beneath the burning sun pursued.</span>
<span class="i0">There, urged by love and youthful hope, he went,</span>
<span class="i0">Loth; but ’twas all his fortune could present. <span class="linenum">750</span></span>
<span class="i0">From hence he wrote; and, with a lover’s fears,</span>
<span class="i0">And gloomy fondness, talk’d of future years;</span>
<span class="i0">To her devoted, his Priscilla found</span>
<span class="i0">His faithful heart still suffering with its wound,</span>
<span class="i0">That would not heal. A second time she heard;</span>
<span class="i0">And then no more; nor lover since appear’d.</span>
<span class="i0">Year after year the country’s fleet arrived,</span>
<span class="i0">Confirm’d her fear, and yet her love survived;</span>
<span class="i0">It still was living; yet her hope was dead,</span>
<span class="i0">And youthful dreams, nay, youth itself, was fled; <span class="linenum">760</span></span>
<span class="i0">And he was lost: so urged her friends, so she</span>
<span class="i0">At length believed, and thus retired with me.</span>
<span class="i0">She would a dedicated vestal prove,</span>
<span class="i0">And give her virgin vows to heaven and love;</span>
<span class="i0">She dwelt with fond regret on pleasures past,</span>
<span class="i0">With ardent hope on those that ever last;</span>
<span class="i0">Pious and tender, every day she view’d</span>
<span class="i0">With solemn joy our perfect solitude;</span>
<span class="i0">Her reading, that which most delighted her,</span>
<span class="i0">That soothed the passions, yet would gently stir; <span class="linenum">770</span></span>
<span class="i0">The tender, softening, melancholy strain,<span class="ws12">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">That caused not pleasure, but that vanquished pain,<span class="ws4">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">In tears she read, and wept, and long’d to read again. &emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">But other worlds were her supreme delight,</span>
<span class="i0">And there, it seem’d, she long’d to take her flight;</span>
<span class="i0">Yet patient, pensive, arm’d by thoughts sublime,</span>
<span class="i0">She watch’d the tardy steps of lingering time.</span>
<span class="i2">My friend, with face that most would handsome call,</span>
<span class="i0">Possess’d the charm that wins the heart of all;</span>
<span class="i0">And, thrice entreated by a lover’s prayer, <span class="linenum">780</span></span>
<span class="i0">She thrice refused him with determined air.</span>
<span class="i2">“No! had the world one monarch, and was he</span>

<span class="i0">Lovely and loving, generous, brave, and true&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Vain were his hopes to waken hers anew!”</span>

<span class="i0">And fancy’s prospects, that she would not lose,</span>
<span class="i0">Would not forego to be a mortal’s wife,</span>
<span class="i0">And wed the poor realities of life.</span>
<span class="i2">There was a day, ere yet the autumn closed, <span class="linenum">790</span></span>
<span class="i0">When, ere her wintry wars, the earth reposed;</span>
<span class="i0">When from the yellow weed the feathery crown,</span>
<span class="i0">Light as the curling smoke, fell slowly down;</span>
<span class="i0">When the wing’d insect settled in our sight,</span>

<span class="i0">When the wide river was a silver sheet,</span>
<span class="i0">And on the ocean slept th’ unanchor’d fleet;</span>
<span class="i0">When from our garden, as we look’d above,</span>
<span class="i0">There was no cloud, and nothing seem’d to move;</span>
<span class="i0">Then was my friend in ecstasies&mdash;she cried, <span class="linenum">800</span></span>
<span class="i0">“There is, I feel there is, a world beside!</span>
<span class="i0">Martha, dear Martha! we shall hear not then</span>

<span class="i0">So had I been, and so had one with me;</span>
<span class="i0">But in this world the fondest and the best</span>

<span class="i2">“Nay, were he here in all the pride of youth, <span class="linenum">810</span></span>
<span class="i0">With honour, valour, tenderness, and truth,</span>

<span class="i0">Than I dare go, who doubtfully agreed.</span>

<span class="i2">She softly smiled, and, as we gravely talk’d,</span>
<span class="i0">We saw a man who up the gravel walk’d&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Not quite erect, nor quite by age depress’d; <span class="linenum">830</span></span>
<span class="i0">A travell’d man, and as a merchant dress’d.</span>
<span class="i0">Large chain of gold upon his watch he wore,</span>
<span class="i0">Small golden buckles on his feet he bore;</span>
<span class="i0">A head of gold his costly cane display’d,</span>

<span class="i2">This comely man moved onward, and a pair</span>

<span class="i0">Till one exclaim’d, and wildly look’d around,</span>

<span class="i0">But she recover’d soon, and you must guess <span class="linenum">840</span></span>

<span class="i0">She in his absence look’d to heaven for bliss;</span>
<span class="i0">He was contented with a world like this:</span>

<span class="i2">For the plain dealer had his wish declared,</span>

<span class="i0">Set all his sail, and for his purpose steer’d;</span>
<span class="i0">Loud and familiar, loving, fierce and free, <span class="linenum">870</span></span>
<span class="i0">He overpower’d her soft timidity:</span>
<span class="i0">Who, weak and vain, and grateful to behold</span>
<span class="i0">The man was hers, and hers would be the gold&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Thus sundry motives, more than I can name,</span>
<span class="i0">Leagued on his part, and she a wife became.</span>
<span class="i2">A home was offer’d, but I knew too well</span>
<span class="i0">What comfort was with married friends to dwell;</span>
<span class="i0">I was resign’d, and had I felt distress,</span>
<span class="i0">Again a lover offer’d some redress.</span>
<span class="i0">Behold, a hero of the buskin hears <span class="linenum">880</span></span>
<span class="i0">My loss, and with consoling love appears.</span>
<span class="i0">Frederick was now a hero on the stage,</span>
<span class="i0">In all its glories, rhapsody, and rage;</span>
<span class="i0">Again himself he offer’d, offer’d all</span>
<span class="i0">That his an hero of the kind can call:</span>
<span class="i0">He for my sake would hope of fame resign,</span>
<span class="i0">And leave the applause of all the world for mine.</span>
<span class="i0">Hard fate was Frederick’s never to succeed,</span>
<span class="i0">Yet ever try&mdash;but so it was decreed.</span>
<span class="i0">His mind was weakened; he would laugh and weep, <span class="linenum">890</span></span>
<span class="i0">And swore profusely I had murder’d sleep,</span>
<span class="i0">Had quite unmann’d him, cleft his heart in twain,</span>
<span class="i0">And he should never be himself again.</span>
<span class="i2">He <i>was</i> himself: weak, nervous, kind, and poor,</span>
<span class="i0">Ill dress’d and idle, he besieged my door;</span>
<span class="i0">Borrow’d,&mdash;or, worse; made verses on my charms,</span>
<span class="i0">And did his best to fill me with alarms.</span>
<span class="i0">I had some pity, and I sought the price</span>
<span class="i0">Of my repose&mdash;my hero was not nice:</span>
<span class="i0">There was a loan, and promise I should be<span class="ws7">}</span><span class="linenum">900</span></span>
<span class="i0">From all the efforts of his fondness free, <span class="ws8">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">From hunger’s future claims, or those of vanity. &emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">“Yet,” said he, bowing, “do to study take!</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</a></span>
<span class="i0">O! what a Desdemona wouldst thou make!”</span>
<span class="i0">Thus was my lover lost; yet even now</span>
<span class="i0">He claims one thought, and this we will allow.</span>
<span class="i2">His father lived to an extreme old age,</span>
<span class="i0">But never kind!&mdash;his son had left the stage,</span>
<span class="i0">And gain’d some office, but an humble place,</span>
<span class="i0">And that he lost! Want sharpen’d his disgrace, <span class="linenum">910</span></span>
<span class="i0">Urged him to seek his father&mdash;but too late:</span>
<span class="i0">His jealous brothers watch’d and barr’d the gate.</span>
<span class="i2">The old man died; but there is one who pays</span>
<span class="i0">A moderate pension for his latter days;</span>
<span class="i0">Who, though assured inquiries will offend,</span>
<span class="i0">Is ever asking for this unknown friend:</span>
<span class="i0">Some partial lady, whom he hopes to find</span>
<span class="i0">As to his wants so to his wishes kind.</span>
<span class="i2">“Be still,” a cool adviser sometimes writes&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">“Nay, but,” says he, “the gentle maid invites&mdash; <span class="linenum">920</span></span>
<span class="i0">Do, let me know the young! the soft! the fair!”</span>
<span class="i2">“Old man,” ’tis answer’d, “take thyself to prayer!</span>
<span class="i0">Be clean, be sober, to thy priest apply,</span>
<span class="i0">And&mdash;dead to all around thee&mdash;learn to die!”</span>
<span class="i2">Now had I rest from life’s strong hopes and fears,</span>
<span class="i0">And no disturbance mark’d the flying years;</span>
<span class="i0">So on in quiet might those years have past,</span>
<span class="i0">But for a light adventure, and a last.</span>
<span class="i2">A handsome boy, from school-day bondage free,</span>
<span class="i0">Came with mamma to gaze upon the sea; <span class="linenum">930</span></span>
<span class="i0">With soft blue eye he look’d upon the waves,</span>
<span class="i0">And talk’d of treacherous rocks, and seamen’s graves.</span>
<span class="i0">There was much sweetness in his boyish smile,</span>
<span class="i0">And signs of feelings frank, that knew not guile.</span>
<span class="i2">The partial mother, of her darling proud,</span>
<span class="i0">Besought my friendship, and her own avow’d;</span>
<span class="i0">She praised her Rupert’s person, spirit, ease,</span>
<span class="i0">How fond of study, yet how form’d to please.</span>
<span class="i0">In our discourse he often bore a part,</span>
<span class="i0">And talk’d, heaven bless him, of his feeling heart; <span class="linenum">940</span></span>
<span class="i0">He spoke of pleasures souls like his enjoy,</span>
<span class="i0">And hated Lovelace like a virtuous boy;</span>
<span class="i0">He felt for Clementina’s holy strife,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And was Sir Charles as large and true as life;</span>
<span class="i0">For Virtue’s heroines was his soul distress’d;</span>
<span class="i0">True love and guileless honour fill’d his breast,</span>
<span class="i0">When, as the subjects drew the frequent sigh, &nbsp;<span class="ws9">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">The tear stood trembling in his large blue eye, <span class="ws9">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And softly he exclaim’d, “Sweet, sweetest sympathy!” &emsp;}</span>
<span class="i2">When thus I heard the handsome stripling speak, <span class="linenum">950</span></span>
<span class="i0">I smiled assent, and thought to pat his cheek;</span>
<span class="i0">But when I saw the feelings blushing there,</span>
<span class="i0">Signs of emotions strong, they said&mdash;forbear!</span>
<span class="i2">The youth would speak of his intent to live</span>
<span class="i0">On that estate which heaven was pleased to give&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">There with the partner of his joys to dwell,</span>
<span class="i0">And nurse the virtues that he loved so well;</span>
<span class="i0">The humble good of happy swains to share,</span>
<span class="i0">And from the cottage drive distress and care;</span>
<span class="i0">To the dear infants make some pleasures known, <span class="linenum">960</span></span>
<span class="i0">And teach, he gravely said, the virtues to his own.</span>
<span class="i2">He loved to read in verse, and verse-like prose,</span>
<span class="i0">The softest tales of love-inflicted woes;</span>
<span class="i0">When, looking fondly, he would smile and cry,</span>
<span class="i0">“Is there not bliss in sensibility?”</span>
<span class="i2">We walk’d together, and it seem’d not harm</span>
<span class="i0">In linking thought with thought, and arm with arm;</span>
<span class="i0">Till the dear boy would talk too much of bliss,</span>
<span class="i0">And indistinctly murmur&mdash;“such as this.”</span>
<span class="i2">When no maternal wish her heart beguiled, <span class="linenum">970</span></span>
<span class="i0">The lady call’d her son “her darling child;”</span>
<span class="i0">When with some nearer view her speech began,</span>
<span class="i0">She changed her phrase, and said, “the good young man!”</span>
<span class="i0">And lost, when hinting of some future bride,</span>
<span class="i0">The woman’s prudence in the mother’s pride.</span>
<span class="i2">Still decent fear and conscious folly strove</span>
<span class="i0">With fond presumption and aspiring love;</span>
<span class="i0">But now too plain to me the strife appear’d,</span>
<span class="i0">And what he sought I knew, and what he fear’d:</span>
<span class="i0">The trembling hand and frequent sigh disclosed <span class="linenum">980</span></span>
<span class="i0">The wish that prudence, care, and time opposed.</span>
<span class="i2">Was I not pleased, will you demand?&mdash;Amused</span>
<span class="i0">By boyish love, that woman’s pride refused?</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span>
<span class="i0">This I acknowledge, and from day to day</span>
<span class="i0">Resolved no longer at such game to play;</span>
<span class="i0">Yet I forbore, though to my purpose true,</span>
<span class="i0">And firmly fix’d to bid the youth adieu.</span>
<span class="i2">There was a moonlight eve, serenely cool,</span>
<span class="i0">When the vast ocean seem’d a mighty pool;</span>
<span class="i0">Save the small rippling waves that gently beat, <span class="linenum">990</span></span>
<span class="i0">We scarcely heard them falling, at our feet.</span>
<span class="i0">His mother absent, absent every sound</span>
<span class="i0">And every sight that could the youth confound;</span>
<span class="i0">The arm, fast lock’d in mine, his fear betray’d,</span>
<span class="i0">And, when he spoke not, his designs convey’d;</span>
<span class="i0">He oft-times gasp’d for breath, he tried to speak,</span>
<span class="i0">And studying words, at last had words to seek.</span>
<span class="i2">Silent the boy, by silence more betray’d,</span>
<span class="i0">And fearing lest he should appear afraid,</span>
<span class="i0">He knelt abruptly, and his speech began&mdash; <span class="linenum">1000</span></span>
<span class="i0">“Pity the pangs of an unhappy man.”</span>
<span class="i2">“Be sure,” I answer’d, “and relieve them too&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">But why that posture? What the woes to you?</span>
<span class="i0">To feel for others’ sorrows is humane,</span>
<span class="i0">But too much feeling is our virtue’s bane.</span>
<span class="i2">“Come, my dear Rupert! now your tale disclose,</span>
<span class="i0">That I may know the sufferer and his woes.</span>
<span class="i0">Know, there is pain that wilful man endures,</span>
<span class="i0">That our reproof and not our pity cures;</span>
<span class="i0">For though for such assumed distress we grieve, <span class="linenum">1010</span></span>
<span class="i0">Since they themselves as well as us deceive,</span>
<span class="i0">Yet we assist not.”&mdash;&mdash;The unhappy youth,</span>
<span class="i0">Unhappy then, beheld not all the truth.</span>
<span class="i2">“O! what is this?” exclaim’d the dubious boy;</span>
<span class="i0">“Words that confuse the being they destroy?</span>
<span class="i0">So have I read the gods to madness drive</span>
<span class="i0">The man condemn’d with adverse fate to strive.</span>
<span class="i0">O! make thy victim, though by misery, sure,</span>
<span class="i0">And let me know the pangs I must endure;</span>
<span class="i0">For, like the Grecian warrior, I can pray, <span class="linenum">1020</span></span>
<span class="i0">Falling, to perish in the face of day.”</span>
<span class="i2">“Pretty, my Rupert; and it proves the use</span>
<span class="i0">Of all that learning which the schools produce.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But come, your arm&mdash;no trembling, but attend</span>
<span class="i0">To sober truth, and a maternal friend.</span>
<span class="i2">“You ask for pity?”&mdash;“O! indeed I do.”</span>
<span class="i0">“Well then, you have it, and assistance too:</span>
<span class="i0">Suppose us married!”&mdash;“O! the heavenly thought!”</span>
<span class="i0">“Nay&mdash;nay, my friend, be you by wisdom taught;</span>
<span class="i0">For wisdom tells you, love would soon subside, <span class="linenum">1030</span></span>
<span class="i0">Fall, and make room for penitence and pride;</span>
<span class="i0">Then would you meet the public eye, and blame</span>
<span class="i0">Your private taste, and be o’erwhelm’d with shame:</span>
<span class="i0">How must it then your bosom’s peace destroy</span>
<span class="i0">To hear it said, ‘The mother and her boy!’</span>
<span class="i0">And then to show the sneering world it lies,</span>
<span class="i0">You would assume the man, and tyrannize;</span>
<span class="i0">Ev’n Time, Care’s general soother, would augment</span>
<span class="i0">Your self-reproaching, growing discontent.</span>
<span class="i2">“Add twenty years to my precarious life, <span class="linenum">1040</span></span>
<span class="i0">And lo! your aged, feeble, wailing wife;</span>
<span class="i0">Displeased, displeasing, discontented, blamed;</span>
<span class="i0">Both, and with cause, ashaming and ashamed.</span>
<span class="i0">When I shall bend beneath a press of time,</span>
<span class="i0">Thou wilt be all erect in manhood’s prime;</span>
<span class="i0">Then wilt thou fly to younger minds t’ assuage&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">Thy bosom’s pain, and I in jealous age <span class="ws8">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Shall move contempt, if still; if active, rage;<span class="ws4">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And, though in anguish all my days are past,</span>
<span class="i0">Yet far beyond thy wishes they may last&mdash; <span class="linenum">1050</span></span>
<span class="i0">May last till thou, thy better prospects fled,</span>
<span class="i0">Shall have no comfort when thy wife is dead.</span>
<span class="i2">“Then thou in turn, though none will call thee old,</span>
<span class="i0">[Wilt] feel thy spirit fled, thy bosom cold;</span>
<span class="i0">No strong or eager wish to make the will,</span>
<span class="i0">Life will appear to stagnate and be still,</span>
<span class="i0">As now with me it slumbers: O! rejoice</span>
<span class="i0">That I attend not to that pleading voice;</span>
<span class="i0">So will new hopes this troubled dream succeed,</span>
<span class="i0">And one will gladly hear my Rupert plead.” <span class="linenum">1060</span></span>
<span class="i2">Ask you, while thus I could the youth deny</span>
<span class="i0">Was I unmoved?&mdash;Inexorable I,</span>
<span class="i0">Fix’d and determined; thrice he made his prayer,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</a></span>
<span class="i0">With looks of sadness first, and then despair;</span>
<span class="i0">Thrice doom’d to bear refusal, not exempt,</span>
<span class="i0">At the last effort, from a slight contempt.</span>
<span class="i2">“Did his distress, his pains, your joy excite?&mdash;”</span>
<span class="i0">No; but I fear’d his perseverance might.</span>
<span class="i0">Was there no danger in the moon’s soft rays,</span>
<span class="i0">To hear the handsome stripling’s earnest praise? <span class="linenum">1070</span></span>
<span class="i0">Was there no fear that while my words reproved</span>
<span class="i0">The eager youth, I might myself be moved?</span>
<span class="i0">Not for his sake alone I cried “persist</span>
<span class="i0">No more,” and with a frown the cause dismiss’d.</span>
<span class="i2">Seek you th’ event?&mdash;I scarcely need reply:</span>
<span class="i0">Love, unreturn’d, will languish, pine, and die.</span>
<span class="i0">We lived awhile in friendship; and with joy</span>
<span class="i0">I saw depart in peace the amorous boy.</span>
<span class="i0">We met some ten years after, and he then</span>
<span class="i0">Was married, and as cool as married men; <span class="linenum">1080</span></span>
<span class="i0">He talk’d of war and taxes, trade and farms,</span>
<span class="i0">And thought no more of me, or of my charms.</span>
<span class="i2">We spoke; and when, alluding to the past,</span>
<span class="i0">Something of meaning in my look I cast,</span>
<span class="i0">He, who could never thought or wish disguise,</span>
<span class="i0">Look’d in my face with trouble and surprise.</span>
<span class="i0">To kill reserve, I seized his arm, and cried,</span>
<span class="i0">“Know me, my lord!” when laughing, he replied,</span>
<span class="i0">Wonder’d again, and look’d upon my face,</span>
<span class="i0">And seem’d unwilling marks of time to trace; <span class="linenum">1090</span></span>
<span class="i0">But soon I brought him fairly to confess,</span>
<span class="i0">That boys in love judge ill of happiness.</span>
<span class="i2">Love had his day&mdash;to graver subjects led,</span>
<span class="i0">My will is govern’d, and my mind is fed;</span>
<span class="i0">And to more vacant bosoms I resign</span>
<span class="i0">The hopes and fears that once affected mine.</span>

<p>It has been asked, if Pope was a poet? No one, I conceive, will
accuse me of vanity in bringing forward this query, or suppose me
capable of comparing myself with a man so eminent: but persons very
unlike in other respects may, in one particular, admit of comparison,
or rather the same question may be applied to both. Now, who will
complain that a definition of poetry, which excludes a great part of
the writings of Pope, will shut out him? I do not lightly take up
the idea, but I conceive that by that kind of definition, one half
of our most agreeable English versification (most generally held, by
general readers, to be agreeable and good) will be excluded, and an
equal quantity, at least of very moderate, or, to say truly, of very
wretched composition, will be taken in. <span class="initials">(O.M.)</span></p>

<p><b>Tale 1.</b> <i>The edition of 1834 contains the following note to
the Quotations</i>: These mottoes are many, because there is a
reference in them not only to the characters, but frequently to the
incidents also; and they are all taken from Shakspeare, because I
could more readily find them in his scenes, than in the works of any
other poet to whom I could have recourse. <span class="initials">(O.M.)</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The evening came: “My Brother, what employs</span>
<span class="i0">Thy mind?” said Richard; “what disturbs thy joys?</span>
<span class="i0">Hast thou not all the good the world can give,</span>
<span class="i0">And liv’st a life that kings might sigh to live?</span>
<span class="i0">Can nothing please thee? Thou wert wont to seize</span>
<span class="i0">On passing themes, and make the trifles please.</span>
<span class="i0">Thy Muse has many a pleasant fancy bred,</span>
<span class="i0">And clothed in lively manner!&mdash;--is she dead?”</span>
<span class="i2">“Not dead but sick, and I too weary grow</span>
<span class="i0">Of reaping nothing from the things I sow.</span>
<span class="i0">What is the pleasure&mdash;thou perhaps canst say&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Of playing tunes, if none can hear thee play?</span>
<span class="i0">Timid and proud, the world I cannot court,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor show my labours for the critic’s sport.</span>
<span class="i0">Hast thou the courage, Richard? hast thou tried</span>
<span class="i0">An Author’s perils? hast thou felt his pride?</span>
<span class="i0">For vain the efforts, and they quickly tire,</span>
<span class="i0">If we alone our precious things admire.”</span>
<span class="i2">“Not so,” said Richard, and acquired a look</span>
<span class="i0">That some expression from his feelings took;</span>
<span class="i0">“Oh! my dear Brother, if this Muse of mine,</span>
<span class="i0">Who prompts the idle thought, the trifling line,</span>
<span class="i0">If she who calmly looks around, nor more</span>
<span class="i0">Muse of the Mad, the Foolish, and the Poor,</span>
<span class="i0">If she can pleasure&mdash;and she can&mdash;impart,</span>
<span class="i0">Can wing the fancy, can enlarge the heart;</span>
<span class="i0">What must a Muse of strength, of force, of fire,</span>
<span class="i0">In the true Poet’s ample mind inspire?</span>
<span class="i0">What must he feel, who can the soul express</span>
<span class="i0">Of saint or hero?&mdash;he must be no less.</span>
<span class="i0">Nor less of evil minds he knows the pain,</span>
<span class="i0">But quickly lost the anguish and the stain,</span>
<span class="i0">While with the wisest, happiest, purest, best,</span>
<span class="i0">His soul assimilates and loves to rest.</span>
<span class="i0">Crowns would I spurn, and empires would I lose,</span>
<span class="i0">For inspiration from the sacred Muse.”</span>
<span class="i2">“A song,” said George, “and I my secret store,</span>
<span class="i0">Confined in dust and darkness, will explore.</span>
<span class="i0">Poet with poet, bard and critic too,</span>
<span class="i0">We fear no censure, and dread no review.</span>
<span class="i0">A judge so placed must be to errors kind,</span>
<span class="i0">And yield the mercy that he hopes to find;</span>
<span class="i0">Begin then, Richard, put thy fears aside;<span class="ws5">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Shall I condemn, who must myself be tried?&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">In me at least my Brother may confide.<span class="ws6">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">In hope of wearing, I shall yield the bays,</span>
<span class="i0">And my self-love shall give my rival praise.” <span class="initials">(O.M.)</span></span>

<span class="i0">“Wilt thou explain? I shall not grieve to share</span>
<span class="i0">A lover’s sorrow, or a husband’s care?”</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</a></span>
<span class="i2">Kindness like this had moved a sterner man,</span>
<span class="i0">Richard much more. He smiled, and thus began:&mdash;</span>
<span class="i2">“No more I loved the sea; that plunge had tamed</span>
<span class="i0">My blood, by youth in idleness inflamed:</span>
<span class="i0">To my affairs I forced my mind t’ attend,</span>
<span class="i0">And sought the town to counsel with a friend.</span>
<span class="i0">Much we debated&mdash;Could I now resign</span>
<span class="i0">My earthly views, and look to things divine?</span>
<span class="i0">Could I to merchandise my mind persuade,</span>
<span class="i0">And wait in patience for the gain of trade?</span>
<span class="i0">Or if I could not early habits quit,</span>
<span class="i0">Had I a stock, and could subsist on wit?</span>
<span class="i2">“Measures like these became my daily themes,</span>
<span class="i0">My airy castles, my projector’s dreams.</span>
<span class="i0">But health, so long neglected, now became</span>
<span class="i0">No more the blessing of my failing frame:</span>
<span class="i0">A fever seized it, of that dangerous kind,</span>
<span class="i0">That while it taints the blood, infects the mind.</span>
<span class="i0">I traced her flight as Reason slowly fled,</span>
<span class="i0">And her last act assured me Hope was dead:</span>
<span class="i0">But Reason err’d, and when she came again</span>
<span class="i0">To aid the senses and direct the brain,</span>
<span class="i0">She found a body weak, but well disposed</span>
<span class="i0">For life’s enjoyments, and the grave was closed.</span>
<span class="i0">But danger past, and my recovery slow,<span class="ws8">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">I sought the health that mountain gales bestow,&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">And quiet walks where peace and violets grow.&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i2">“Now, my dear Brother, when the languid frame</span>
<span class="i0">Has this repose, and when the blood is tame,</span>
<span class="i0">Yet strength increasing, and when every hour</span>
<span class="i0">Gives some increase of pleasure and of power,</span>
<span class="i0">When every sense partakes of fresh delight,</span>
<span class="i0">And every object wakes an appetite;</span>
<span class="i0">When the mind rests not, but for ever roves</span>
<span class="i0">On all around, and as it meets approves;</span>
<span class="i0">Then feels the heart its bliss, that season then is love.</span>
<span class="i2">“Think of me thus disposed, and think me then</span>
<span class="i0">Retired from crowded streets and busy men,</span>
<span class="i0">In a neat cottage, by the sweetest stream</span>
<span class="i0">That ever warbled in a poet’s dream;</span>
<span class="i0">An ancient wood behold, so vast, so deep,</span>
<span class="i0">That hostile armies might in safety sleep,</span>
<span class="i0">Where loving pairs had no observers near,</span>
<span class="i0">And fearing not themselves, had none to fear;</span>
<span class="i0">There to fair walks, fresh meadows, and clear skies,</span>
<span class="i0">I fled as flee the weary and the wise.” <span class="initials">(O.M.)</span></span>

<span class="i0">Where can the wretched lose their cares, and hide</span>
<span class="i0">The tears of sorrow from the eyes of pride?</span>
<span class="i0">Can they in silent shades a refuge find</span>
<span class="i0">From all the scorn and malice of mankind?</span>
<span class="i0">From wit’s disdain, and wealth’s provoking sneer, &nbsp;&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">From folly’s grin, and humour’s stupid leer,<span class="ws8">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And clamour’s iron tongue, censorious and severe?&emsp;}</span>
<span class="i0">There can they see the scenes of nature gay,</span>
<span class="i0">And shake the gloomy dreams of life away?</span>
<span class="i0">Without a sigh, the hope of youth give o’er,</span>
<span class="i0">And with aspiring honour climb no more.</span>
<span class="i2">Alas! we fly to peaceful shades in vain;</span>
<span class="i0">Peace dwells within, or all without is pain:</span>
<span class="i0">No storm-tost sailor sighs for slumbering seas&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">He dreads a tempest, but desires a breeze.</span>
<span class="i0">The placid waves with silent swell disclose</span>
<span class="i0">A clearer view, and but reflect his woes.</span>
<span class="i0">So life has calms, in which we only see</span>
<span class="i0">A fuller prospect of our misery.</span>
<span class="i2">When the sick heart, by no design employ’d,</span>
<span class="i0">Throbs o’er the past, or suffer’d, or enjoy’d,</span>
<span class="i0">In former pleasures finding no relief,</span>
<span class="i0">And pain’d anew in every former grief.</span>
<span class="i0">Can friends console us when our cares distress,</span>
<span class="i0">Smile on our woes, and make misfortunes less?</span>
<span class="i0">Alas! like winter’d leaves, they fall away,</span>
<span class="i0">Or more disgrace our prospects by delay;</span>
<span class="i0">The genial warmth, the fostering sap is past,</span>
<span class="i0">That kept them faithful, and that held them fast.</span>
<span class="i2">Where shall we fly?&mdash;to yonder still retreat,</span>
<span class="i0">The haunt of Genius and the Muses’ seat,</span>
<span class="i0">Where all our griefs in others’ strains rehearse,</span>
<span class="i0">Speak with old Time, and with the dead converse;</span>
<span class="i0">Till Fancy, far in distant regions flown,</span>

<span class="i0">And were the mighty orbs above us known,</span>
<span class="i0">No world would seem so trifling as our own.</span>
<span class="i2">Here looking back, the wond’ring soul surveys</span>
<span class="i0">The sacred relics of departed days,</span>
<span class="i0">Where grace, and truth, and excellence reside,</span>
<span class="i0">To claim our praise, and mortify our pride;</span>
<span class="i0">Favour’d by fate, our mighty fathers found</span>
<span class="i0">The virgin Muse, with every beauty crown’d:</span>
<span class="i0">They woo’d and won; and, banish’d their embrace,</span>
<span class="i0">She comes a harlot to their feebler race:</span>
<span class="i0">Deck’d in false taste, with gaudy shows of art</span>
<span class="i0">She charms the eye, but touches not the heart;</span>
<span class="i0">By thousands courted, but by few caress’d,</span>
<span class="i0">False when pursued, and fatal when possess’d.</span>
<span class="i2">From hence we rove, with Fancy for our guide,</span>
<span class="i0">O’er this wide world, and other worlds more wide,</span>
<span class="i0">Where other suns their vital power display,</span>
<span class="i0">And round revolving planets dart the day;</span>
<span class="i0">Where comets blaze, by mortals unsurvey’d,</span>
<span class="i0">And stray where Galileo never stray’d;</span>
<span class="i0">Where God himself conducts each vast machine,</span>
<span class="i0">Uncensured by mankind, because unseen.</span>
<span class="i2">Here, too, we trace the varied scenes of life,</span>
<span class="i0">The tyrant husband, the retorting wife,</span>
<span class="i0">The hero fearful to appear afraid,</span>
<span class="i0">The thoughts of the deliberating maid;</span>
<span class="i0">The snares for virtue, and the turns of fate,</span>
<span class="i0">The lie of trade, and madness of debate;</span>
<span class="i0">Here force deals death around, while fools applaud,</span>
<span class="i0">And caution watches o’er the lips of fraud;</span>
<span class="i0">Whate’er the world can show, here scorn derides,</span>
<span class="i0">And here suspicion whispers what it hides&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">The secret thought, the counsel of the breast,</span>
<span class="i0">The coming news, and the expected jest....</span>
<span class="i0">High panegyric, in exalted style,</span>
<span class="i0">That smiles for ever, and provokes a smile,</span>
<span class="i0">And Satire, with her fav’rite handmaids by&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Here loud abuse, there simpering irony....</span>
<span class="i0">All now display’d, without a mask are known,</span>
<span class="i0">And every vice in nature, but our own.</span>
<span class="i2">Yet Pleasure too, and Virtue, still more fair,</span>
<span class="i0">To this blest seat with mutual speed repair;</span>
<span class="i0">The social sweets in life’s securer road,</span>
<span class="i0">Its bliss unenvied, its substantial good,</span>

As the author’s purpose in this Tale may be mistaken, he wishes to
observe, that conduct like that of the lady’s here described must
be meritorious or censurable just as the motives to it are pure or
selfish; that these motives may in a great measure be concealed from
the mind of the agent; and that we often take credit to our virtue
for actions which spring originally from our tempers, inclinations,
or our indifference. It cannot therefore be improper, much less
immoral, to give an instance of such self-deception.</p></div>

rests on the horse-tail and other perennial herbs, which in part
conceal the shallowness of the stream; a fat-leaved pale-flowering
scurvy-grass appears early in the year, and the razor-edged
bull-rush in the summer and autumn. The fen itself has a dark and
saline herbage; there are rushes and <i>arrow-head</i>, and in a few
patches the flakes of the cotton-grass are seen, but more commonly
the <i>sea-aster</i>, the dullest of that numerous and hardy genus; a
<i>thrift</i>, blue in flower, but withering and remaining withered
till the winter scatters it; the <i>saltwort</i>, both simple and
shrubby; a few kinds of grass changed by their soil and atmosphere,
and low plants of two or three denominations undistinguished in a
general view of the scenery;&mdash;such is the vegetation of the fen when
it is at a small distance from the ocean; and in this case there
arise from it effluvia strong and peculiar, half-saline, half-putrid,
which would be considered by most people as offensive, and by some
as dangerous; but there are others to whom singularity of taste or
association of ideas has rendered it agreeable and pleasant.</p></div>

Fasil was a rebel chief, and Michael the general of the
royal army in Abyssinia, when Mr. Bruce visited that country. In all
other respects their characters were nearly similar. They are both
represented as cruel and treacherous; and even the apparently strong
distinction of loyal and rebellious is in a great measure set aside,
when we are informed that Fasil was an open enemy, and Michael an
insolent and ambitious controller of the royal person and family.</p></div>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
